<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>M</span>R. JARRAD was a tall, lean man, with very
quiet eyes, an observant air, and an impassive
face. His clothing was unobtrusive
and seemed to have arrived at that point of age at
which clothing shows no further sign of wear. He
was standing near the fireplace of an old-fashioned,
oak-paneled room, and from his expression one might
assume that he beheld its entire contents at a glance.
Presently he fingered a bowl on the gray stone mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One blue six-inch Delft, slightly chipped in two
places on the upper edge,” he drawled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another man, rather younger, somewhat fatter, was
seated at a table. He had something of Mr. Jarrad’s
world-weary manner, but the process had not been carried
quite so far, and he looked rather less diffident.
He raised his eyes from a large book spread open before
him and nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the upper edge,” he repeated mechanically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad put his ear to the clock. “One black
marble timepiece, apparently in good order, lower left-hand
corner damaged, complete with key. Keyhole
slightly scratched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we have that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older man paused, took a swift inspection of his
surroundings, pulled in his lower lip, and nodded
thoughtfully. “Matter of fact, Mr. Dawkins, when I
compare this room with several thousand others I’ve
inspected, I rather like it. Wouldn’t mind having it
myself, and in our profession that’s about as far as
one can go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins put down his pen. “I had an idea that
by this time you were past liking anything in the line
of furnishings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two twelve-inch pewter candlesticks, all feet bent.
You’re not right there. After thirty years of inventory
work one sometimes becomes thankful in a sort
of negative way for the things one does not see. This
is one of those times. I generally look about, take the
whole show in with one squint, and ask myself why
people commit such crimes. Did you ever reflect
how much humanity is run by things, just things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I haven’t, and I don’t think they are. Things
have no influence, no effect. They can’t run anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarad grunted, “Matter of fact, they do.
You think again. The getting together of things
makes jobs for you and me in the first place. Therefore
they run us. There was no inventory work in
prehistoric days. And, apart from that, the collecting
of them is the finish of at least half the entire number
of what we call civilized women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins laughed. “It’ll never finish my woman.
We haven’t got any to speak of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His companion nodded approvingly. “Keep on
like that, if you can, and you’ll do; but it isn’t as
easy as you think. It’s the bargain that you really
don’t want here, and the job lot there—the gradual
accumulation of things—that makes life drag and
anchors their souls as well as their bodies. Stop and
think a minute. First of all, when a girl is married
she starts collecting. Children may come, but she goes
on with the collecting in between. It takes her mind
off the children. The collection grows and grows.
As a general rule about half the articles are not ornamental,
and about half are never used. That makes
no difference; she goes on. At middle age, Dawkins,
they’ve got her; she’s surrounded by them. Carved
wood from Uncle John in Burma, Birmingham brass
from Egypt, assagais from her brother in Africa, deer
heads from Scotland, and perhaps an elephant’s foot
from Ceylon, all as ugly as ugliness can be. Some of
these things may have certain virtues, or”—here Mr.
Jarrad hesitated a little—“or certain disadvantages, but
she can’t appreciate that, because they are lost in the
general ruck. After a while she dies; the new generation
comes along, holds up its hands, says what a
frightful collection, throws it all out, and begins the
same process over again under new rules.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having delivered himself of these sentiments, Mr.
Jarrad indulged in a smile that was a little quizzical.
His face, though shrewd, had no touch of cynicism,
and this in spite of the fact that he had spent thirty
years in estimating other people’s property. This
interminable procession produced in his mind rather
a curious effect, and he had acquired the habit of
estimating his fellow-men by the things the latter
owned and apparently treasured. Experience enabled
him to form an excellent appraisal of the individual by
merely walking through his house. He could visualize
the owner. And if sometimes the job bored Mr.
Jarrad, he never disclosed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said just now,” he went on with a wave of the
hand, “that I rather liked this room. These things
are good and not too numerous. They practically
all fit. Of course they belong to Mr. Thursby, except
the portrait, but, if they could, I’ve an idea they’d
sooner still be owned by Mrs. Millicent. Mr. Thursby
made his money very quickly during the war, and
Mrs. Thursby isn’t the kind to collect such as this.”
He touched a bit of lacquer with what almost amounted
to a caress. “Ever hear the story? It’s short, but
not pretty. It rather got hold of me, because there’s
more in it than meets the eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins shook his head. “I’ve never been in this
part before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. Millicent, who lived here for years with
his wife and daughter, died very suddenly in this very
room. He was a strange, remote sort of gentleman,
so I’m told, and a great traveler. About middle age,
he was. Had a habit of sitting up late, reading and
writing, enjoyed perfect health, enough money to live
on so far as people knew, and apparently without an
enemy in the world. At ten o’clock one evening he
was found lying across that desk with a wound in his
throat big enough to put your hand into.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” said Dawkins, startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad shrugged his shoulders. “That’s what
the coroner and the local police and the London detective
tried to find out, and failed. No proof against
any one; no strange characters about, no clues, nothing
found afterward, nothing whatever to go on; but it
happened in this sleepy old place where there’s nothing
but roses and scenery. It’s never been cleared up to
this day, and probably never will be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins glanced about rather uncomfortably.
“Then the place was sold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Millicent couldn’t get out quickly enough.
The Thursbys came along in their car, offered half its
value, and got it. They said they didn’t mind a
murder or so if the drains were good. When they
moved in they intended to stay; but they moved out
in less than six months, and I’m told that Mrs.
Thursby said that nothing on earth would induce her to
stay. Interesting, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a queer old house anyway. Not haunted,
is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heard a whisper of that, and it’s the sort
of thing you can’t keep quiet if tongues start wagging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” murmured Dawkins reflectively, “if
my client knows about this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad’s brows went up. “In our profession it
does not concern us what our clients may or may not
know. Our business is to establish the physical
condition of a lot of infernally uninteresting things.
But, believe me, every house has its secret. We can’t
report on that; we can’t even read it, because we’re
not there long enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins nibbled the end of his pen. “I wonder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? Every room I go into seems to want
to say something to me, something it’s tired of keeping
to itself, but I hurry through because I don’t want
to be burdened. When you’ve been an inventory
clerk a few years longer, it will come to you. You
can’t escape it.” He paused, his gaze traveling
round the oaken walls, then peered under the clock,
swung out a picture, and examined the surface behind
it. He touched this with a moistened finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Condition in general I should say is excellent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It struck the younger man that for some time he had
been accepting Mr. Jarrad’s conclusions without
comment; so he got up and made a businesslike
inspection on his own account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only fair, I should say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad made a little noise in his throat.
“There’s not much to disagree about. Shall we
arbitrate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older man felt in his pocket, produced a coin,
and tossed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heads,” said Dawkins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s tails,” Mr. Jarrad smiled blandly. “Make a
note of that, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins moved back to the table and began to
scribble. The next moment he became aware that
some one had entered the room and stopped short.
Mr. Jarrad was regarding a woman who stood just
inside the door and surveyed them with grim attention.
Neither man had heard her come. Her face was well
formed but sallow; the chin rather square, the nose
long and thin. Her lips were immobile and slightly
compressed. It was the eyes that held the two
appraisers, being large and black and filled with a kind
of slow, smoldering light. Her figure, tall, spare,
and angular, carried with it an odd suggestion of
menace. Her air was one of distinct animosity.
Dawkins gave a slight start. A short silence followed,
and he wondered how long she had been there, also
how much she had seen and heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Derrick is just coming up the drive,” she said
crisply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad rubbed his hands as though they were
cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excellent,” he replied with obvious relief. “My
colleague and I have just completed our work. I
understand you are the housekeeper, Miss Perkins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am the housemaid; at least, I was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it may interest you to know that we find the
place in admirable condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins seemed unimpressed, took a slow glance
round the room, and disappeared. Nor did Mr.
Jarrad appear to expect any reply. Dawkins did
not speak but whistled softly. Since the history of
this room had been unfolded, it had become rather
oppressive, and the sudden advent of this strange
woman added mysteriously to his uncomfortable
sensations. He experienced a swift longing for light
and air. Mr. Jarrad had crossed to the fireplace
and was staring at an oil portrait over the hearth.
Presently he stroked his long chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That woman, I believe, came here soon after
Mr. Millicent first came. She was here when he died,
then stayed with the Thursbys during their occupancy,
took charge of the house when they decided they had
had enough; and, Dawkins, I don’t mind betting she’ll
stay with your clients too, as long as they stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins gave an involuntary shiver. “What holds
her in such a lonely place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every house has its secret,” said Mr. Jarrad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment quick steps sounded in the hall,
there was an echo of a young, strong voice, and the
new tenant of Beech Lodge entered the room. Dawkins
jumped up, while Mr. Jarrad assumed an air of
professional dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon, sir,” he said. “My colleague
and I have just finished our work, and you will be glad
to know that all is in excellent order. You may be
assured that your interests have been well looked
after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick, a tall young man with restless eyes, nodded
casually. He did not seem much impressed, being
busy with a swift scrutiny of the study. The mellow
paneling, big fireplace, wide oak-planked floor, the
large, companionable desk, and the French window
opening to the smooth lawn all gave it an atmosphere
at once restful and intimate. He felt as though he
could turn out good stuff here. Then he nodded contentedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks very much, but I think you’d better see
Miss Derrick about these things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad and Dawkins made two stiff little bows
which were absurdly alike and gathered up their
papers. Derrick, left alone, moved automatically to
the fireplace and stood staring at the oil portrait.
He was in this attitude when his sister entered, short,
alert, and businesslike. He glanced at her with a slow,
provocative smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, here we are. Am I forgiven for a snap
decision?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really I don’t know yet. I’ve hardly seen the
place, but it seems very comfortable, and I know
what took your eye. Isn’t getting settled an awful
feeling? When will the Thursbys be here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He consulted his watch. “They should be here
now; early in the afternoon, Thursby said. Did you
inquire about servants?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and I wanted to speak to you about that
maid. Did you notice her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather; who wouldn’t? She mesmerized me
when I came here the first time.” He laughed. “Do
you want her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Jack, the question is the other way.
If you insist on renting a house two miles from anywhere,
the first thing to decide is whether your prospective
servants want you. As to this one I don’t
exactly know. She rather gives me the creeps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, old thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sent him an odd smile in which there was
no comfort. “I can’t say; probably nothing at all
but the move, and this house, and all the rest of it.
Jack, why were you so keen on it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked about, almost as though he saw something
more than pictures and furniture. There was
something more; he had been sure of that the first
time he put foot in the room, but it was not the sort
of thing one could explain or even justify.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really don’t know,” he said slowly, “but I was,
and without any question. The rest of this house is
what one might expect to find, but this room, well, I
took a special fancy to it, and here we are. That’s
about as much as you can expect from the ordinary
man. I can do good work here from the feel of the
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She examined the study with curious interest.
Comfortable? Yes. Workmanlike? Yes. A man’s
room with nothing in it that was not completely livable.
A few books in corner cases; a few good prints framed
in harmony with the walls; the big, flat desk, leather-covered
as to the center, with its dark mahogany edge
showing long and careful usage; the leather chairs,
men’s chairs, large and inviting; the great fireplace in
its dull, oaken setting; all this dominated by the oil
portrait, from which a pair of quiet brown eyes looked
out with a gaze at once striking and contemplative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But did you find anything unusual about this
room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so sure now; but, yes, I did. You know
my weakness for jumping to conclusions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brows wrinkled. “I’m glad you admit that at
the very start. You were tired with a flat in town,
passed this place, and saw the sign. You walked
through it and fell a victim, as you often have before.
The immediate result is that we’ve made an extra
effort to gratify your whim, though I’m afraid it’s
really more than we should have attempted. You’ll
be much happier, Jack, if you admit this at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” grinned Derrick, “but I’d never have fallen
had I not a very competent sister who I knew would
save the situation. You’re quite right, Edith; I
really can’t afford it, but the place was dirt cheap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m afraid it’s going to be something of the
same sort with that maid, who will want more than
you can really afford to pay; just another luxury we’ll
have to live up to. In a lonely spot like this a servant
asks top wages; and we’ll need two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick hardly heard this. There was an odd little
singing in his ears, as though a myriad of tiny voices,
long held silent, had suddenly found a myriad of
minute tongues. Well, he could wait for the rest.
He went back to his discovery of Beech Lodge, the
inspection under the guidance of its silent caretaker,
the interview with the agent, and the growing conviction
that he must take this house at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much does the maid ask?” he hazarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I’m almost afraid to inquire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is a bit formidable,” he admitted; then, slowly,
“I wonder whether we’ve taken the house, or the house
has taken us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sister glanced at him, puzzled. “I don’t quite
follow; but isn’t the result the same in either case?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “I’m not so sure about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith Derrick was prone to confess that she had
never quite understood her brother, but had so far
maintained that she was better able to look after him
than any other woman. He was the only man in her
life, and she was not ready to surrender him; but of
late the going had become more difficult. She did,
however, understand well enough not to attempt to
fathom his moods and with a certain placid good
nature put them down to the vagaries of the creative
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the past few months he had been caught up in
the ambition to write the one great book of his career.
This would demand solitude and concentration and,
above all things, a garden of his own. So when he
returned from a prospecting trip and announced that
the abode of his dreams was discovered and secured,
Edith packed their belongings and journeyed into
Sussex, determined not to be disappointed, yet prepared
for the worst. In Beech Lodge she found but
little to criticize, so little that she wondered mutely
why the terms were so low. The place was comfortable
but to her in no way fascinating, and her chief
thought was of her own responsibilities in keeping the
domestic wheels turning smoothly. If there were
anything else behind this, anything that exercised
a peculiar fascination on her brother, it would doubtless
be apparent later on. Meantime he was in one of
his moods. She glanced at the placid features above
the mantel, wondering whose they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s quite obvious that Mr. John Derrick has one
of his preoccupied sensations to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “As a matter of fact I do feel a bit
queer, but there’s no anxiety in it, just the preliminary
quiver to settling down.” He paused and glanced at
her oddly. “I had no alternative.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From coming here. I mean I was meant to
come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled indulgently. The thing about him was
that he was different from all the men she knew. A
good deal of the boy, a touch of the woman in his
gentle persistence, whimsical, sensitive, calling her to
aid him in a thousand ways he never saw, his mind
open to winds of influence that she could only guess at;
how much and how constantly he needed her! She
admired his work, which she could not fully appreciate,
and believed him capable of anything. Something
of this was in her look, and he put an arm caressingly
on her shoulder, then perched on the corner of the big
desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we’re going to be jolly happy and comfortable
here, and I’ll certainly get a lot of work done.
That’s a man’s way of putting it, and if you only—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off suddenly, jerked up his hand, and
stared at it strangely. “Well, I’ll be dashed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent forward quickly. “What’s the matter,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flexed his fingers, shook his head with some
confusion, and, turning, leaned over and examined
the big desk. “Don’t know,” he said awkwardly;
“probably only writer’s cramp; but it never took me
before. Perhaps I’d better get a typewriter, though
I hate the things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith was about to speak when there came an almost
inaudible knock at the door, and Perkins entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, madam, Mr. and Mrs. Thursby are
walking up the drive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you; please bring them in here. And,
Perkins—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, madam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It—it doesn’t matter now. I’ll see you afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman went out, and Derrick glanced at his
sister with genuine curiosity. This was very unlike
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Edith, what’s up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She blinked and pulled herself together. “Nothing
at all, Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t think of keeping that person if you don’t
fancy her. There must be others available.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an extraordinary expression she has! It
made me feel a little cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coming of the Thursbys reduced the atmosphere
of Beech Lodge to an undoubted normal. Mr.
Thursby was short, brisk, alert, and highly colored
both as to clothes and complexion. He spoke in a
sharp staccato voice that carried unfailing self-assurance.
A manufacturer in a small way before the war,
he had seized opportunity with both hands and made
his fortune by sending in regular supplies of handgrenades,
of which, though they were unloaded when
they left his works, he seemed at first almost afraid.
This uncertainty, however, soon left him, and after the
Armistice he made an excellent settlement in respect
of partially completed orders, winding up his business
with a credit balance that surprised even himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if her husband’s rotund person was eloquent
of commercial success, his feminine counterpart reflected
no less this satisfactory <span class='it'>dénouement</span>. She had
a round, plump face; stubby and equally plump fingers,
weighted with rings of varying value and brilliancy;
full, red cheeks, and a penetrating, high-pitched voice.
She wore all she could, and on top of this a mountain
of glossy furs. The Thursbys, man and wife, reeked
of money; but were naturally good-hearted people
whom money could not quite spoil. And from their
present manner it would seem that they were genuinely
interested in Derrick and his sister. Mrs. Thursby
glanced round, nodded at the sight of familiar things,
and settled herself comfortably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m very glad to meet you, Miss Derrick,” she
said cheerfully, “and isn’t it odd to come into one’s
own house and find some one else sitting there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Derrick smiled. “I suppose it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do hope you like the place, and if there’s anything
I can tell you about it you’re very welcome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a good deal larger than I expected, but it
seems very homelike, and my brother evidently fell
in love with it at first sight. The things in it are
charming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad they appeal to you, but as a matter of fact
I chose hardly any of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Thursby nodded complacently. “That’s so!
I picked up the place just at it stood, with practically
everything in it. We were motoring past, just like
your brother, saw the sign, took a fancy, and bought
it the very next day. I don’t believe in haggling over
prices when you see what you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, what’s more, we took it over with the servants
just as they stood, too,” chimed in his wife.
“The only trouble was that they stood too much; in
fact, all of them except Perkins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really,” said Edith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied Thursby genially, “she couldn’t
get a job on the strength of her looks, but I never knew
a servant do so much work and make so little fuss over
it. The thing is to forget her face, if one can. How
do you like Beech Lodge, Mr. Derrick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much; but I suppose that since I’m the guilty
party in taking it, I couldn’t say anything else. This
room appeals to me, especially.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he said this, he intercepted a glance that Mr.
Thursby darted at his wife, and experienced a curious
conviction that these two were trying hard to conceal
their satisfaction at having unloaded the house on
some one else. He saw the plump lady on the sofa
shake her head ever so slightly. Mr. Thursby stiffened,
got a shade redder in the face, and his eyes rested
for a fraction of a second on the features over the
mantel, as though asking their late owner whether he
required any publicity. The features evidently telegraphed
back that he did not. Whereupon Mr.
Thursby looked more genial than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a good, comfortable room,” he agreed, “but I
generally used the little one off the dining-room. It’s
warmer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Thursby gave a slight shiver and regarded the
Derricks with renewed and unaffected interest. “I
dare say it will sound very queer to you, but neither
of us cared much for this room. For my part I like
something brighter than old wood and old pictures.
Never cared much for leather, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith betrayed no surprise. She quite understood.
But what did puzzle her was that people of the
Thursby type should ever have bought this ancient
mansion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You weren’t here very long, were you?” she
ventured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Six months,” said Mr. Thursby; “six months,
then we went off to France. I wanted to see some of
the places where they used my grenades.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you make that stuff?” asked Derrick, amused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tons of it. Ever use them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick smiled. “Rather, but,” he put in hastily
as his visitor brightened and prepared to talk shop,
“one doesn’t say anything on that score now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d be awfully obliged if Mrs. Thursby would
show me something about the house up-stairs,” said
Edith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thursby laughed. “Your sister is as practical as
my wife, Mr. Derrick, so I’ll take the opportunity of
showing you one or two things outside that may be
useful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed in an odd way glad to get out of the
room, and Derrick listened to a disquisition on roses
and mulch, Thursby being an authority on both.
Beech Lodge had a reputation for its roses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Mrs. Thursby, left alone with her
hostess, glanced at the latter rather uncertainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to Perkins, Miss Derrick, I really don’t know
that I can tell you very much. She isn’t the sort
about whom one can say much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d really be very grateful for anything you can tell
me. Might I ask how long you had her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only six months or so. We weren’t in the house
any longer than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then did you ascertain anything about her before
that? I mean, had she satisfactory references?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Thursby shook her head with what seemed
unnecessary decision. “No, we found her here, just
as you found her, or your brother. She was practically
part of the house, and, looking back at it, I can’t
imagine the house without her. Of course she had
been with Mrs. Millicent, whom I have never seen,
though she lives near here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith experienced a sudden curiosity about the
Millicents, but something in Mrs. Thursby’s expression
suggested that information on this subject would be
forthcoming before long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you found Perkins quite satisfactory? It
would help me a good deal to know, because, frankly,
I don’t see what keeps a woman in such a lonely
spot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is absolutely clean and superior, very superior.
As for being lonely, I saw no sign of it. She never
once left the place, even to go to the village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Derrick smiled. “That’s very good news, but
I was just wondering if she isn’t too superior for us.
We’re going to live very quietly. My brother can’t
stand interruptions when he’s writing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other woman sent her a look of candid scrutiny,
then shook her head. “Miss Derrick, I’m going to
tell you something that will sound queer, but it’s perfectly
true. Perkins will like you a good deal better
than she liked us. She made no pretense of that,
though she was always most respectful. But I felt
it just the same. I got the idea, and still have it,
that she looked on us as intruders. I can’t for the
life of me say why such a thing should be, but there
you are, and I know it seems ridiculous. But Beech
Lodge is too far from anywhere for its occupants to be
over particular about trifles, and I put the thing out of
my head—or tried to, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s curious,” said Edith reflectively; “she seems
very respectful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s the soul of respect, but I’m not sure what
it’s for. Also she was too reserved for me. And she
appeared to be afraid she’d say too much and let
something slip she didn’t mean to. You asked about
her references, but as a matter of fact I hadn’t the
cheek to inquire for any, and took it for granted that
she went with the house, whoever took it. I didn’t
even write to Mrs. Millicent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is Mrs. Millicent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith put the question impulsively, and Mrs.
Thursby’s eyes sought the portrait that hung just
above her head. She did not answer at once but
seemed to be debating how much she might say.
When finally she did speak, it was with a reluctance
that was gradually overcome by the interest of her
subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We bought the place from her but only saw the
agent. Mrs. Millicent herself was ill at the time and
on the south coast with her daughter. Mr. Millicent
had just died here, very suddenly, and she did
not want to come back. She’s never been back
since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know that,” said Edith slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and it happened in this very room.” Mrs.
Thursby spoke more confidently now, warming a
little, as though it was good to remember that it was
now some one else’s room. “Mr. Millicent was found
at that very desk and, I’m told, found by Perkins,
who was devoted to him. Then his wife put the house
on the market at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith took a long breath. “I wish I’d known
that,” she said thoughtfully, “but I’m glad somehow
that I’ve heard it at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would it have made any difference? I thought
every one hereabouts knew it. Didn’t Perkins say
anything about it to your brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing whatever, and, Mrs. Thursby, please, I
don’t want him to know just yet. I hope your husband
won’t say anything. Jack is so sensitive and
imaginative that it would divert him completely from
his work, which at the present is very important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stout woman laughed. “My husband is probably
talking hard about roses and garden-mold.
He’s got that on the brain now instead of grenades,
and it’s much healthier. And if I were you I
wouldn’t worry about Mr. Millicent. So now you
know how we found Perkins, and I must say she kept
the house spotless. But she was so quiet that it did
get a bit on my nerves. She went about as though
expecting something or some one, till I used to feel like
asking her to shout out who or what it was. And, as
I said, she never liked me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How very strange!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I’ve rather let myself go on the subject,
but I’ve told you all I know. It may be that Perkins
likes things old and subdued like this, while I confess
that I like them more new and shiny. Perhaps that’s
why she wants to stay, if she does want to. I know
how you can find out without asking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” said Edith curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she smiles at you, it will be all right. She never
smiled at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I should need rather more than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Thursby shook her head impulsively. “I
don’t believe you will. It’s a queer sort of house, if I
do say it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever imagine it was haunted?” Miss
Derrick knew the question sounded childish, but it
came out involuntarily. Much to her surprise Mrs.
Thursby took it quite seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did at first, but soon got over that. No, we’ve
never been bothered. There’s a bit of creaking now
and then, but not more than in any house of this sort,
and certainly we never saw anything.” She paused,
then went on quite frankly. “The real reason I came
here to-day was to see whether it was likely that you
and Perkins would hit it off, and if not I would have
advised you to get rid of her, if you could; but whether
the queerness is in the house or in her I really don’t
know. It’s somewhere, not the sort of thing that can
hurt, but that one just feels without knowing why.”
She paused a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to your brother, I’d advise you to say nothing
at all if he’s the kind of man you describe. He’s
bound to find out for himself. And if you’re wondering,
Miss Derrick, why we should have let you take
the house and then talk about it like this, the reason
is that I may be misjudging Perkins altogether, and
the whole affair may just be the result of my own
imagination. Don’t take any notice of her, and everything
should be all right. Now tell me: does it seem to
you that I’ve said a lot of foolish things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. I think you’ve been extremely kind,
and, if I may say so, very honest, and it should all
help very much, especially with Perkins. My brother
had to have a quiet place to work in, and this should
do admirably. I really don’t believe in ghosts; neither
does he.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll find it quiet enough here,” replied Mrs.
Thursby significantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Voices sounded in the hall, and Derrick entered
with his landlord. He looked pleased, as though
Beech Lodge had revealed unexpected attractions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to have lots of roses next summer,
Edith. Never saw a better lot of trees. Mr. Thursby
has shown me everything. Place out there I can work
in, too, when the decent weather comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith nodded. “How very nice!” She turned
to Mrs. Thursby. “One of my principal duties is to
keep out of the way of a toiling author, yet to be on
hand when wanted. Jack has always pictured himself
working in a garden. Now we’ll have some tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true, but who’s going to look after the
roses? What about your late gardener, Mr. Thursby?
Is he available for a man of moderate means?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I don’t know where he is. There
should be somebody in the village who’d like the job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m sorry we can’t stay for tea,” put in his
wife; “we have rather a long way to go.” She stole
a glance at the portrait, her expression suggesting to
Edith that there were already too many in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So thanks just the same,” said Thursby, “but as
a matter of fact we have to be back in town within the
hour, and that means hustling. We’re off to France
for a while next week, but not the battle-fields this
time. If you’re ready, Helen, we’ll make a start
now. Good-by, Miss Derrick, and I hope you’ll be
comfortable. My agent will look after any repairs, if
you let him know. It may be we’ll pass here again,
and if so I’ll drop in. And I want to read that book
when it comes out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke so abruptly that Miss Derrick was a little
startled and felt now that while Mrs. Thursby had
told her a good deal it was probably not all. Her first
impulse was to betray nothing to her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you really stay for a few minutes? Tea is
ready.” She rang the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d love to,” Mrs. Thursby assured her hastily.
“But it’s quite impossible. I hope we’ll have better
luck next time.” She put out a plump hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick indulged in a puzzled glance. The manner
of their departure was unmistakably hasty. He intercepted
another wordless signal and felt suddenly
amused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you like tea in the other room?” he
hazarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little man shook his head with decision. “It
isn’t that at all, I assure you.” Then the door opened,
and Perkins stood motionless on the threshold, her
eyes fixed on Miss Derrick. She seemed unaware
there were others present. Mrs. Thursby busied
herself with her gloves and did not look up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You rang, madam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Thursby are not staying for
tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick had a strange conviction that Perkins knew
this without being told, but the severe face of the maid
changed not at all. She disappeared into the hall,
followed shortly by the young man and his visitors.
There were a few words of good-by and a final
assurance that Beech Lodge would be found homelike
and comfortable. Edith looked after them in silent
wonder. Why were they so anxious to leave? The
excuse had sounded something more than hollow.
The whole affair had been queer and unnatural. Then
she too stared at the portrait, as though asking what
it all meant. Presently sounded the horn of a car and
the dwindling note of an engine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick came back, and she regarded him expectantly.
How much of it had he caught? It was the
dream of his life to write his biggest book in a place
like Beech Lodge. But he was sensitive, imaginative,
and subjective, and she dreaded the impression this
strange and mysterious atmosphere might produce.
The uncertainty made her feel a little cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s done!” he said, rubbing his hands.
“And I’ve nothing more to learn about the grounds.
Thursby must have spent a good deal of money on
the place. It’s odd that he left it, because in a way he
seems still keen on it. Funny chap, that. He was
almost apologetic about what he had done in the
way of improvements. Anyway, here we are in full
possession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what I feel, and, Jack, I do hope it will
be just what you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is absolutely. I know that already, if you don’t
find it too slow and remote. I’m a bit guilty on that
score. I suppose there are some of the right sort in
the neighborhood, and the Millicents are not far off.
Did you learn anything satisfactory about that maid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said slowly. “Mrs. Thursby’s report
is that she’s very competent and trustworthy and
possibly willing to do the whole thing herself. So I
think I’ll keep her if she’ll stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. I thought you would. A bit out of the
common, that woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened as he spoke, and Perkins came in
with the tray. The two glanced at each other, and
watched her silently. The long, deft fingers moved
with a sort of definite precision, lingering over the
silver as though the touch of it conveyed an actual
pleasure. This deliberate procedure was marked by
a noiseless precision. One could not imagine a woman
like this making a mistake. Her face, absolutely
impassive, betrayed nothing. While she was in the
room she seemed part of it, and from her there
spread something that almost suggested ownership.
Then she went out, as silent as themselves. Derrick
sat up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George!” he said softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “Hanged if I know yet; something in
the air. Probably it’s only the new and rather ideal
surroundings that set one’s fancy going. You don’t
feel anything, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only that I want my tea dreadfully. I had quite
a talk with Mrs. Thursby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort is she? Like her husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think so. Limited, you know, but
doesn’t put on airs and is very honest apparently.
She actually said that Perkins made her feel like an
intruder but that it would be different with us. She
says we suit Beech Lodge better than they did. It
was rather pathetic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put down his cup. “I can easily imagine that.
The people who modernized Beech Lodge are our own
sort and have a good deal in common with us. For
instance, when the Thursbys picked up the place I
don’t believe they were meant to, or expected. It’s
different now. We were. I knew that as soon as I
stepped into the hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be absurd, Jack! Expected by whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perkins, for one, and no doubt by other people,
or things; it doesn’t matter which, but I’m sure
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack,” she protested. “You’re rambling!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he answered slowly, “you just remember
this talk, and see. We blend with the place, we’re
suitable and acceptable, while the Thursbys were not.
That’s obvious at a glance, and they certainly felt it
themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could we be expected by any one who
didn’t know us? You can’t explain that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her with sudden gravity. “Did you
never have a curious sensation that you were doing
things for the second time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you’re joking. Have some more tea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, “I’m not, and there’s no explanation
for it. In fact I’ve an idea that they’re not meant
to be explained; at least not yet. But I felt it the
minute I got here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Jack,” she protested, “you saw the house;
you liked it, especially as you couldn’t quite afford it;
and of course you were impulsive and took it. What
has that to do with a servant, or any one else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps nothing whatever. It’s a wonderful
place to work in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that’s the best way to look at it. What
did Mr. Thursby talk about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mostly roses and mulch.” He broke off suddenly,
regarding his sister with an intense and puzzled
expression. “I’ve an extraordinary impression that
some one died in this room not long ago; some one
who didn’t want to die and wasn’t ready for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” she stammered. “Please,
Jack, don’t go off on that tack the very day we reach
here. You’ll never get anything done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean just that; I’m perfectly sure some one
did. Perkins will know, and, I say, perhaps that’s
what—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack,” she interrupted hastily, “please leave Perkins
to me. When Mrs. Thursby was here she said
that there was a sudden death in this room about two
years ago, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Millicent?” he shot out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said helplessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murdered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I assumed that. He was found at his desk.
Mrs. Thursby seemed to want to say more, and yet
not want to.” Miss Derrick paused, aware of her
brother’s penetrating gaze. He would soon know it
all in any case, and perhaps it was wisest to clear the
air as much as possible at the outset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I understand why the rental asked was so
low,” she continued. “The Thursbys simply got
frightened. But I’m astonished you asked no questions
on your account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head and stared at the portrait. “The
questions will come later on. I haven’t got them
ready yet. By the way, Edith, that’s Millicent over
the fireplace. He’s been trying to tell me something
ever since we came into the house; what you call a
speaking likeness. Now I’ve got it, and he’s trying
to smile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you wouldn’t go on like that, Jack. Please
don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nothing in the world to be nervous about.
This sort of thing is going on all the time around all
of us. Some see it, and others don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how did you know?” she asked nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t tell you that; it’s not a matter of reason or
information. Some people call it the influence of the
inanimate, which is rather a bald way of putting it.
I’ve got the idea that it’s the permanence of things
that are universally put down as lost, or at any rate
as only transient. Just imagine, for instance, that
nothing is really lost, but that everything, every act
and motion, and even word, is registered in some kind
of extraordinarily delicate vibration, so delicate that it
is quite imperceptible to the average person. But the
record is there nevertheless; in fact the entire universe
is throbbing and quivering with such records that he
who can may read, or at least perceive. Go a little
further and admit that the more tense the act or word
the more keen the pitch of the ethereal record, and one
begins to appreciate what is really implied by what we
call coincidence, and how it is that often, after many
years, mysteries are solved that long baffled any approach
to solution. It really means that some one was
sensitive enough to decipher the record that was always
there. I’ve an idea it may turn out like that in the
case of Millicent. And when you ask me how I knew
some one died suddenly in this room, I can’t answer in
any other way than this. I just knew; that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith felt utterly confused. She was a practical
girl, with a healthy dislike of anything that might
upset the normal progress of every-day affairs, and for
years had stood between her brother and the drab
realities of life, in order that his fancy might have untrammeled
swing. Imagination, either on her own
part or that of others, had never heretofore caused her
any discomfort. She admitted its value, but the process
by which it worked was beyond her. Now, however,
she experienced a sudden distaste for her new
surroundings. Derrick’s eyes had taken on an intense,
far-pitched stare as though he were probing things beyond
her own ken. He seemed to be moving away
from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if I’m going to like this house,” she
hazarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled himself together and laughed. “Buck
up, old thing, and you mustn’t mind if I wander a bit.
It’s too late to take exceptions after signing a year’s
lease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at him seriously and a little anxiously.
“It’s only that you’ve been in a sort of half-world
ever since we got here. Now I must settle this matter
of Perkins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right! And I’ve got to find a gardener. And look
here, Edith; speaking of half-worlds, isn’t it possible
that that’s about all we get in any case—the obvious
half?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be so introspective, and see if you can’t find
something cheerful outside. And, Jack, will you ask
Perkins to see me here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed her and strolled to the door. “If I may
make a foolish manlike suggestion it would be that
when you’re talking to Perkins you try to imagine this
place without her. I’ve tried and failed. I’ll send
her in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat for a moment, deep in thought, till very soon
it seemed there was nothing to be anxious about after
all. Her brother’s fanciful mind had merely unearthed
something which he must inevitably have discovered
before long. The mystery might hold him for
a few days, till his restless imagination moved on elsewhere.
It had always been like that in the past. The
fact that Millicent died here two years ago could mean
nothing to new tenants. All houses were built to live
and die in. Beech Lodge was charming and well arranged,
and they had leased it on nominal terms. It
was true that the terms were, perhaps, suspiciously
nominal, but she pushed this thought aside to make
room for others more helpful and constructive. She
confessed to being piqued with herself for giving any
evidence of discomfort, and would in future take less
notice of her brother’s whimsical ideas. Then she
looked up and saw Perkins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sent for me, madam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Derrick regarded her with absorbed interest.
How old was this woman? At first appearance she
seemed never to have been young, but her smooth skin
and straight figure suggested that she could not be
much past forty. It was the grave, inscrutable face
that baffled. It carried no trace of expression and revealed
no play of the mind. In the dark eyes moved
a kind of secret light, quickening at times into a fleeting
gleam that was instantly extinguished. In these
moments Perkins appeared to receive communications
from a source privy to herself, messages that illumined
a nature of which the outer world knew but little;
and, save for these occasional and passing glimpses,
her face was like a mask. Miss Derrick, held for an
instant voiceless by something she could not understand,
wondered what sort of private life had been led
by a woman who looked like this. The pause lengthened,
but Perkins stood, passive and undisturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had a talk with Mrs. Thursby,” said Edith
rather stiffly, “and she mentioned you. It was quite
satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flatness of her tone announced that it was immaterial
what Mrs. Thursby might have said. Obviously
the latter meant nothing to Perkins. There
was no superiority in her manner; just a total lack of
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So if you would like to stay now, I would be very
glad to have you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins’s thin lips moved ever so slightly, and the
faintest trace of a smile flitted over the blank features.
She made a little gesture that put her late employer
definitely out of the reckoning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always stay, madam,” she said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith stared at her. “Why always? I don’t quite
understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came here to Mrs. Millicent, and”—here there
was again the ghost of a smile—“I even stayed with
Mrs. Thursby, and I’m quite willing to stay with you.
People come and go, but nothing has really changed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This announcement was made with such calmness
that Miss Derrick found herself for a moment robbed
of speech. Whoever came or went, this woman
would always be at Beech Lodge, no more detachable
than the roof which covered it. Jack had suggested
that his sister try to imagine the place without Perkins,
and now she saw what he meant. She began to recognize
herself as part of a procession which passed
before the sphinx-like eyes of this house-parlor-maid,
a procession to which the woman ministered in order
that she might live, but to which she revealed no fraction
of her inner self. It was strange to be thus classified.
But what was the alternative?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you are so fond of the house,” she said
uncertainly; “and now it comes to a matter of wages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins’s eyes wandered to the portrait over the
mantel. Wages, it seemed, were the last thing in
her mind. “There will be no difficulty about that,
madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Derrick leaned forward involuntarily. “I
don’t quite understand. They are very important, to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, madam, that I don’t ask for high wages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Derrick, though greatly puzzled, breathed a
sigh of relief. “The most I can pay is forty pounds
a year. And of course there’s a cook to be found.
Can you help me there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins’s face softened a shade. “Forty pounds will
be quite sufficient, and you will not need a cook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But are you sure you can do it all?” Miss Derrick
felt distinctly bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, madam.” The woman said this with so complete
a finality that the subject closed forthwith. It
was something more than mere competency. There
was no spark of animation in her expression. Her
attitude suggested that while household duties were
unavoidable they were also of a secondary character,
and the conversation was becoming pointless. Edith
wondered whether some personal tragedy were not hidden
behind this immutable barrier and experienced a
throb of sympathy at the narrowness of such a life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Perkins, I realize that you are taking on a
good deal of work. You must not overtax yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is only work of the hands, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new mistress of Beech Lodge shifted her
ground hastily. “Is this house very old?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This room is the oldest part; about two hundred
years, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have got very fond of the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman looked slowly about. Her lips were
slightly parted, and her eyes were full of shadows,
like the eyes of those who know exactly what they are
about to see. Something might have been passing
from her to those mellow panels in exchange for some
other communication she was drawing from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been here for eight years, madam; and it
may be that the place has got fond of me.” She said
this with a subtle change in her tone, as though for an
instant she had lifted a corner of a curtain in order
to test the other woman’s perception of what lay beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t quite follow you there, Perkins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, madam? It doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Derrick remembered what Mrs. Thursby had
said about wanting to tell the woman to shout out
whatever was in the back of her head and have done
with it. It was understandable now, and she felt the
same desire. The difficulty was going to be to regard
Perkins simply as a maid and not a creature of mystery.
Again she tried to think of Beech Lodge without
her, and again she failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you must have been very lonely here,
especially after Mr. Thursby left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was never alone, madam. That is—” She
broke off in strange confusion. “I never feel lonely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Derrick shivered in spite of herself. She perceived
something now; but it was only a curtain, with
no suggestion of what was behind. A thought darted
through her brain. She recalled the strange manner
of Mrs. Thursby, her restlessness, her obvious desire
to get away, especially from this room. Mrs.
Thursby had felt like an intruder, that round-faced,
good-natured, unimaginative woman. Perhaps all
were intruders here except Perkins, even Millicent
himself. At the recollection of Millicent her pulse
faltered. Perhaps that was why Millicent had been—She
forced herself to speak evenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perkins, will you please be quite candid with me
and say whether you have ever seen anything in this
house which—which should not be here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black eyes rounded. “I do not understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever seen what you thought was a ghost?
I know there are no such things, but some people
think they see them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are no ghosts here, madam.” She shook
her head slowly. “I would know if there were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then will you explain what you meant when you
said you were never alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins made the same slight indefinite gesture.
“I’m sorry I said that, madam, and it was foolish of
me. It’s only my fancy and doesn’t mean anything.
Perhaps it’s my way of filling up empty hours, and
sometimes I say things without thinking. You surprised
me, because Mrs. Thursby never asked me any
questions like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Derrick pulled herself together. “Well, Perkins,
perhaps you’re quite right, and it really doesn’t
matter. I suppose it’s the strange house and the feeling
of not being settled that makes one curious about
all kinds of things. When you’ve had your tea please
come up-stairs, and I’ll show you about the linen.
Also I hope you’ll help me all you can to make matters
go smoothly in the house, on account of Mr. Derrick’s
writing. It’s important he should be disturbed
as little as possible. And,” she added genially, “please
don’t fill your head with fancies about never having
been alone.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>PERKINS</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>M</span>ISS DERRICK left the room, and Perkins
stood motionless as though she welcomed
its silence. Her eyes took on a strange
expression as she scanned this apartment, with every
least detail of which she was utterly familiar. The
paneling ran nearly to the ceiling, and was topped by
a narrow shelf. The west wall was dominated by the
fireplace, and in the corner, placed at a slight angle
from the wall itself, was the big desk. Sitting there,
one looked not out through the French window, but
almost directly at the door from the main hall. The
desk was already littered with Derrick’s manuscript,
and toward it Perkins moved as in a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put one thin hand on the smooth leather surface,
then bent over the massive frame, searching, it seemed,
in the manner of one who hopes she may not find.
Her attitude suggested that she had done this many
times before, and always with the same result; but it
did not affect the swift and silent touch with which
she fingered the heavy mahogany corners and deep,
carved molding of its intricate design. Presently she
shook her head with a sort of patient resolution and
turned on the portrait a look of extraordinary inquiry,
as though Millicent’s eyes, peering from the pigment,
could have directed her—if they only would. The picture
might have been alive, so keen was her regard,
so expectant of an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evening had drawn on, and the study became
peopled with soft mysterious shadows in which she
stood like a priestess before some half-veiled shrine.
She made no movement toward the lamp but in the
gloom progressed without a sound from point to point,
with here and there a lingering touch to furniture and
woodwork. These intimate caresses blended her the
more completely with all that surrounded her till she
was merged and absorbed into the bodily human presentment
of wood and stone. Finally she came directly
under the portrait, bent her head in an attitude
of profound thought, and remained quite motionless.
She was standing thus when the front hall door opened
and Derrick’s whistle sounded cheerily outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that the maid smiled to herself with sudden
pleasure, crossed the room swiftly, and became occupied
with the tea-tray. Derrick entered. He did
not see her at first and started at a slight rattle of
china.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jove, Perkins, you made me jump! I thought you
were part of the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not answer. He sent her a quick searching
glance, stood by the mantel, and, taking out his pipe,
watched her silently. How amazingly she fitted into
everything! No, he could not imagine Beech Lodge
without this woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will want to work now, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “Yes, I think I will”; then, suddenly,
“I say, how did you know I wanted to work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave a queer, twisted smile, the first he had seen
on that ageless face—a strange and almost grotesquely
communicable look, with which she stepped at once
from the rôle of servant and became a sort of administrator
of something yet to be explained. But there
was no lack of respect in her manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought perhaps you might, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took out the tray and, returning in a moment,
adjusted the heavy curtains over the French window.
He watched her light the desk-lamp and turn it low,
feeling rested and soothed by every deft and noiseless
movement. His senses were comforted by the indescribable
certainty of her touch, which gave him an
extraordinary feeling of confidence—in something.
And Perkins must know what this was. Presently
he went to the desk and fingered his manuscript.
It struck him that what he had already written was a
little unreal and undirected. It didn’t go deep enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I make up the fire, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you. It’s not worth while till after
dinner. But I’d like the lamp higher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came slowly toward him. “Have you really
seen this room by firelight, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her curiously and instantly pictured
this ancient chamber with warm shadows flickering
over its mellow casements. Depth and warmth; that’s
what it would be, had always been. He knew this
much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you might make up the fire after all.
Good suggestion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She obeyed, and he watched the effect—more fascinating
than he had imagined. The study took on a
new and ghostly beauty. Its dancing shadows were
populous with fantasy that died and was born while
he stared. There were tenants of the past here that
no change of ownership could ever displace; reminders
of spoken things that had drifted from vanished
lips; echoes of songs whose lilt had never become silent.
It had ceased to be a room. It was a palace of
dream and vision. And in the background stood
Perkins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George!” he said under his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you’d like it, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was half invisible, and he started violently.
“It’s wonderful, but I expected that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s strange how one can tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at her, as though he had known her all
his life. “There is something about this room, and
I felt it the first time I came in. How old is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has no age, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick did not seem surprised. “I thought you’d
say that.” He paused; then as though resuming some
previous talk, “Who else has felt it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only Mr. Millicent since I came here, and his
daughter. It was different with Mrs. Millicent, and
she was frightened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I understand that, too. Was this his favorite
room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that is his desk. I think that at the end he
was frightened as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you found him. How was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made an indefinite gesture. “They sent for
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he felt nothing of surprise. “Yes, because
they had seen and knew. But why did you stay here
after it happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins took one long, uncertain breath. “I did
go away for a week, but I couldn’t stay. It was all
silent in London where I went. Then I knew that it—that
they would not let me remain away, so I had
to come back.” She gazed round this well-remembered
room and seemed to signal that she acknowledged
its potency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick looked at the littered desk and into the
mask-like face. Her eyes were alight now, and not
those of a lonely woman. She was, as it were, surrounded
by friends. He wondered if they would ever
be his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mind talking like this? I think I understand,
but most people wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It makes me happier. For two years there have
been no living words about it. I could never find
any one who understood at all since it happened, and
Miss Millicent would not speak.” She hesitated, and
sent him the faintest smile. “For the last two days
the house has been amused.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” he demanded. Beech Lodge seemed to be
stirring about him, and with slow palpitations of a
monstrous life, throbbing in one vast pulse on which
Perkins kept a cool, knowledgeable finger. It moved
and breathed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was at the men who came to take the inventory.
They were such children; though one of them, and he
was quite old, guessed at something in a general way.
The other could never hear or see anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded and, turning, caught a yellow flicker that
touched the portrait into a strange similitude of life.
Millicent’s eyes were speaking now, strange things to
which he had no key. But only for a little while.
The key was not far away. There came over Derrick
the profound conviction that this was all arranged.
It belonged to the cycle of appointed things. The
stage was all set. If he could but keep his ears tuned
to the elusive vibrations that permeated this solitary
dwelling, he might decipher its mystery. And Perkins
was part of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that like Mr. Millicent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded, with no surprise that he should know
whose portrait it was. “Yes, and there was something
about him very like you, sir. Not in appearance,
but the other thing. He once told me that he began
to hear and understand a little while he was a child.
They commenced to talk before he left his first school.
I’m glad, sir, that Miss Derrick does not understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because she told me not to be lonely, as if one
could. She thinks I’m a little mad, and that’s why
I’m willing to stay here and not ask high wages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not answer, beginning now to perceive why
he had been led to this isolated spot. Millicent stared
down at him, and he was persuaded that from the
picture proceeded a thin appeal for help—or was it for
revenge?—Millicent whose life had been so suddenly
snuffed out—Millicent who had been afraid before he
died. Afraid of what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not afraid too, sir, are you? It’s no use
if you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head, scanning thoughtfully the books,
the prints, the dull paneling, and heavy oaken floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You believe,” he said slowly, “that all this has
sucked in year after year something from mortality,
something that is never quite lost, till, in time, wood
and stone and paper become something much more
than this, and radiate back to us, if we can only catch
it, the wisdom and courage and love and evil they
have so long absorbed. You believe all this, Perkins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes opened wide, filling with a strange light.
She was no longer an impassive, middle-aged woman,
the servant of the house, but a creature vibrant with
feeling, as one who has unleashed her soul. Her lips
moved inaudibly, as at some mystic shrine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wisdom and courage and love and evil,” she
repeated in an awed whisper. “Yes, yes, that’s it, all
of it. Last time it was evil in Beech Lodge. The
evil had been here for months and years, growing
stronger and stronger. It began when Mr. Millicent
got back from the East, and it never stopped. I tried
to silence it but failed, and then it silenced him. The
evil was too strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s over now,” said Derrick steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s here yet, in this room,” she pointed to the
portrait. “He knows. He’s been trying to tell me
but cannot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From whom does it come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, sir; you’re not ready yet. Nothing is quite
ready, but it will be soon. That’s why you came.
The others will come, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He experienced a remarkable sensation of having
lost all physical weight, and seemed to catch a low
singing note as of a myriad of tiny voices, the far
murmur of those who approached from the unknown.
He could see Perkins, still motionless, and feel his own
body, but this had no significance. As the wireless
operator tunes his set till it abstracts from the invisible
only that which is carried by its own individual
wave-length and remains unaffected by all others, so
Derrick began to pick up a series of vibrations that in
a queer and remote fashion he recognized, but could
not as yet interpret. Then he caught his own tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this air is full of that which can never die or
disappear, and may save or destroy as it is written.
It destroyed Millicent and may be the undoing of
others unless it is brought to naught.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How else could it be?” Perkins covered her pale
face, bent her head, and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick stared at the portrait, his features transfigured
with something that was not altogether wonder.
It was all unreal yet enormously real. What
surprised him most was that he should be admitted so
readily to this “no man’s land” where mystery, like a
cloaked figure, moved among the shadows of tragedy.
How much was here? How much of it was his own
fancy? Who was the real Millicent, the man within
the man who had been afraid before he died? How
and why did Millicent die? Did evil take on an
embodiment and, emerging like an apparition from the
unknown, butcher him where he sat? Derrick pictured
him, shrinking back into his chair with starting eyes
while something moved closer, closer. And then—</p>

<p class='pindent'>A knock sounded at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, sir, the inventory men would like to
come in for a moment.” The impassive mask had
fallen over her face again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh! I thought they had finished.” He spoke
jerkily, aware that the study had suddenly become void
and silent. “All right, they may come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shuffle of footsteps in the hall, and Mr. Jarrad
entered deferentially, hat in hand. He was followed
by Dawkins. The younger man looked amused, and
a trifle superior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg pardon for disturbing you like this, sir, but
on looking over our notes I find that my colleague has
omitted to make an entry concerning this desk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything the matter with the desk?” asked Derrick
curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, it’s merely the point of its physical condition,
which would naturally affect any possible question
of dilapidations. When I examined it I noticed
a large stain on the leather, quite faint and dull. It’s
the sort of thing one generally finds on desks of this
character, especially when there happen to be young
people in the family. I did not detect it till for some
reason I made a second inspection. Now it seems that
either I did not mention this for record or, if I did, my
colleague failed to make the entry. So with your
permission I’ll show it to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick felt no surprise. “Certainly,” he said
mechanically. “Do you need more light?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad shook his head, advanced to the desk,
reverentially moved a sheaf of manuscript, put on his
glasses, and bent low over the glossy surface. Dawkins
stood at his elbow looking openly incredulous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see anything, just the same,” said the latter,
“and a stain is a stain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad shifted the lamp and peered hard.
“Curious,” he murmured to himself. “How very
curious! I could have sworn that—ah—there, my
friend,” he nodded with satisfaction, “you can see
it now. It seems a little more difficult to place than
the last time, but there it is, and quite large.” He
ran a thin finger over an irregular outline. “In a
certain light it might be almost invisible. Very faint,
I admit, but surely your young eyes are as sharp as
my glasses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins scrutinized, nodded, mumbled an apology,
and made an entry in the large book. Mr. Jarrad
turned to Derrick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I referred to, sir, and it’s not my
habit to overlook small things. The foundation of a
sound inventory business is system plus what might
be called perception.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perception?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. It involves a certain amount of sensitiveness,
strange as that may sound, and the ability
to perceive and record what is usually, in fact
one might almost say always, missed by the casual
observer. It’s not altogether a matter of training,
either, but of instinct. Possibly there’s not one man
in a hundred who would have spotted that; and if
I were fanciful, sir, I would hazard the opinion that
the desk was trying to hide it, which is of course
absurd. In fact, though I see that you yourself have
been sitting here, I am sure you did not observe it.
Thank you, sir, and good night! We’ll be of no
further trouble now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This oration being delivered in his very best manner,
and the dignity of his profession thus established,
Mr. Jarrad retired. When the steps died out, Derrick
looked for himself. Close under the lamp he
discerned a shadowy blotch of irregular shape, a rough
pool with a tone a shade darker than the leather. It
had apparently been subjected to hard rubbing. It
was a discoloration of no particular hue, but as he
gazed he knew without doubt that it had been made
two years previously by the life-blood of Henry
Millicent.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE MAN FROM THE EAST</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span> WEEK passed at Beech Lodge, while Derrick
endeavored to get down to work; but in spite
of every effort, progress seemed impossible.
Ideas, when they came, were illusory; his characters
imbued themselves with strange aspirations and qualities,
and plot after plot was displaced by the secret
but constantly strengthening conviction that this novel
was not, for the present at any rate, the most important
thing in life. More than ever he was fascinated
by Millicent’s study and the nameless advances seemingly
made by the portrait of its late owner, and sat
at the big desk for hours, fingering his pen, grasping
at thoughts that continually eluded him. By the end
of the second week he was assured there was something
the dead man wanted him to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all this he said nothing to Edith, and it was a
relief to know that she was of too practical a nature
to harbor imaginings similar to his own. Her days
were spent in settling down, and he agreed thankfully
with all she proposed, stipulating only that the study
itself should remain absolutely undisturbed. That
room, he announced with an air of great contentment,
had been designed and equipped to suit his particular
fancy. When he said this it seemed that the portrait
of Millicent signaled its silent approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one evening when he was at the desk, trying
as usual to classify his own thoughts, that Edith looked
up from the book in her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack,” she said suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put down his pen with relief. There were
whispering shadows in the corner, and one could not
work to-night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell me something, quite honestly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled and nodded. “It’s no particular effort
to be honest with you. What am I suspected of now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced into the leaping fire, and turned with a
quick, familiar motion. “How’s the book going? I
do so want to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t making what one would call absolutely
triumphant progress. It’s generally that way at first.
Then later on you realize that you’ve done far
more than you thought, and the happy issue is in
sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know yet whether Beech Lodge is as good
a place to work in as you expected?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is, quite,” he said slowly. “It’s a new
atmosphere, and one doesn’t get it at once, but whatever
I write here will be different and”—he hesitated
an instant—“I think stronger than anything I’ve done
yet. I can see that already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you haven’t any second thoughts about
the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have, quite a lot. They’re not sorted out
yet. What about you? Too busy to think at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at him oddly. “I’ve been trying to be
too busy but haven’t quite succeeded.” She said this
with a touch of reluctance, as though confessing to
some feminine weakness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope they’re pleasant thoughts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not altogether, Jack. Sometimes they’re queer
and sometimes a bit disconcerting. Foolish for a
woman like me to talk like this, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed easily. “I know no person less foolish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not answer but continued to gaze into the
fire, her eyes a little disturbed. Her brother wanted
time to think, being convinced that it was most
important that for the present at any rate Edith
should remain unaware of certain things. Perkins,
for instance. However competent Perkins might be,
she could not in any sense be called a normal woman.
Perhaps he was not at this time normal himself.
Something assured him that no revelation would be
made from the unknown to his sister. Her wireless
set might be affected, but it was not tuned to the
right wave-length. After all, there was no reason why
matters should not proceed smoothly enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are your reflections disconcerting?” he
hazarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. It’s stupid of me, and I call myself
an idiot for being affected at all. The funny thing,
Jack, is that I’m gradually beginning to consider
myself absolutely superficial to something or other—I
don’t know what. The house is running well, and
Perkins is a treasure; a little chilling at times, but
the best servant I’ve ever had. Things seem to do
themselves at her desire. Why should I feel superficial?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “You’re anything but that.
What else is the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing whatever, and yet—” She got up restlessly
and balanced herself on the corner of the desk
close to the dull stain. But it had no message for her.
“If you say definitely that we made no mistake in
taking Beech Lodge, I’ll feel a lot better. Isn’t it
silly of me? There’s everything here one wants, and
all a housekeeper could desire, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt a touch of apprehension and laughed it off.
“You’re only a bit lonely, and probably I’ve been
selfish in planting you in such a lonely spot for the sake
of that confounded novel. I admit to being a bit
spoiled. But we have neighbors. What about the
Millicents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re about three miles from here in a cottage.
Perkins tells me the daughter is twenty-two and very
pretty but has never got over her father’s death. They
were devoted to each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll see them soon,” he said involuntarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly think so. They would not call under all
the circumstances; at least it would be strange if they
did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not, but—” He broke off. “Tell me
more of what’s in your mind. You know what you
are to me, and I can’t help feeling rather responsible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s hard to tell you without seeming an utter fool.
It vexes and amuses me all at once,” she said simply.
“It’s things I’ve never been conscious of before. I’m
not actually conscious of them now, but it’s as if
something had suggested their existence. At the same
time I know I’ll never quite understand. I’m not
built that way. Perhaps I get something through what
I feel for you because you feel it, even though it’s past
me. Does this all sound like gibberish? Then again
it is as though both of us were being threatened. I
wonder if you understand that all this is so different
from anything I’ve felt before that I don’t quite know
what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick listened seriously. His first impulse was
to laugh her mood away, but instantly there came to
him from the surrounding shadows a warning that on
no account must he be false to that which he himself
believed. Pondering this, he knew that he could not
deny these mysterious powers that now proclaimed
themselves. He might desert their kingdom, but to
disown it was impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the place does not agree with you, we’ll chuck
it,” he said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sent him a whimsical smile. “You know that’s
out of the question, dear old boy. We simply can’t;
we’re in too deep for the next year. And forgive me
if I talk to you as though you were my sister, for
that’s one of my selfish habits, and it’s really your own
fault for standing it. Here we stick till that novel is
finished and sold. I’m sorry it doesn’t go as fast as
you would like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will when I get shaken down,” he answered
doggedly. “Trouble is that one is apt to think of too
many things at once. Then follows the discarding and
selecting process, and I suppose I’m going through
that now. The point is to be sure of retaining what
is really worth while; and, when I begin to feel that, it
means confidence and progress. In that last novel I
didn’t quite know what to discard, and it jumps at me
from every page. But now,” he concluded with a little
lift in his voice, “I’ve an idea that I’m just on the
edge of something big.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While your sister,” she murmured absently, “has
a perfectly ridiculous sensation that she’s just on the
edge of something deep, and hasn’t the slightest
intention of falling over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sent him a companionable smile and was soon
lost in her book. Derrick struggled on with his opening
chapters, thankful that she had made no searching
inquiry into his own inward sensations. There was
no sound save the methodical turning of a page and the
scratch of a pen. The fire puttered its ruddy comfort,
and Beech Lodge was dipped in an abyss of silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the inner edge of one of the heavy curtains
that hung over the French window stirred ever so
slightly and at one point drew very slowly aside,
leaving a narrow oval gap on the border of which a
man’s fingers, short, broad, and strong, were visible.
This gap widened inch by inch, till, framed in the dull
fabric, there appeared a face. A mass of tumbled
hair surmounted a low forehead, beneath which moved
eyes that were dark, shining, and restless. The man
might have been forty, with tanned skin, large and
rather uncouth features, a broad mouth, heavy lips—blue-black
and unshaven—and a strange, furtive expression.
No part of his body was visible below the
chin, and the face hung as though suspended like a
threatening mask in mid-air. The roving eyes searched
the room, darting from place to place with extraordinary
quickness, and reflecting little pin-points of
light from the leaping flames. Finally they rested on
Derrick and his sister with a look in which surprise
mingled with a certain unconquerable composure.
There was no fear in the look but rather the suggestion
that this formidable stranger from the dark had been
here before and was now making up his mind on some
vital matter. Then the lips widened into a grin rendered
repulsive by discolored teeth; the gap narrowed
as silently as a leaf falls; face and fingers diminished
and disappeared; the curtain trembled and hung
straight; and there drifted into the room the faintest
possible sound from without. It was over, like a
baleful dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick looked up sharply. “Who was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith, perceiving nothing, stared at him. His face
was tense, his eyes very wide open. She struggled
against a foolish sense of alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this room. Did any one come in just now?”
He peered about, searching the dancing shadows,
keyed suddenly to a strange pitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one,” she said. “Who could there be? I
heard nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s odd,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She got up, stood beside him, and put a hand on his
arm. “What’s odd, Jack? I wish you wouldn’t go
on like this—and don’t be so mysterious, unless you
want it to get on my nerves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had an extraordinary feeling that for a moment
we were not alone.” He laughed, but it sounded a
shade forced. “Dreaming as usual, I suppose. Sorry,
Edith; I won’t do it again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Miss Derrick, in spite of herself, had turned a
little pale. For the past hour she had been trying to
put out of her head a succession of strange thoughts
about strange things, and she had nearly succeeded.
Now she felt dizzy. Perhaps they had not been alone.
But who could it have been? Mystery, breathless, confusing,
and baffling, stole in on her like a secret assailant,
attacking all senses save that of fear. Her
pulse slowed—and beat tumultuously. She stepped to
the bell and rang hard. Derrick looked at her with
wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter? There’s nothing to be
frightened about!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?” she stammered. “I feel
queer because I don’t know. I want to see some one
who isn’t just ourselves,” she went on chaotically,
“and I’m the more vexed because it has to—to be
Perkins.” She covered her eyes unconsciously, like
a child. “Jack, Jack, what is the matter with me?
I’m acting like a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his arm round her. “I’m awfully sorry,
dear, but, really, it’s nothing. I hardly knew I spoke.
Of course it is nothing. I’ll search the house if you
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But would you find it?” she whispered. “Would
you find it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Came a tap at the door, and Perkins entered, her
face as blank as ever. Edith controlled herself with
an effort and looked straight into the basilisk eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perkins, has any one come to the house just now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maid glanced at her, impassive and inscrutable.
“No, madam. Was any one expected?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith could but answer with another question.
“You—you have heard nothing within the last few
minutes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing whatever, madam.” The voice carried
no suggestion of surprise, but Perkins’s eyes met those
of Derrick for a passing instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. Please go to my room, and—and
bring me a handkerchief. Are all the windows and
doors fastened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, madam, except this one. Mr. Derrick told
me to leave that to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She disappeared. Derrick laughed and lit his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re answered now, Edith! The house closed
tight as a drum, and the only access from outside
through this room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you’re right! Yes, of course you are;
but, when she comes back, say something that will keep
her for a minute; say anything at all. Please do that.
I can’t explain, but I must hear some other voice, even
Perkins’s comfortless accents. Jack, I am a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not very complimentary to my powers of
entertainment,” he chuckled. “I won’t write any more
to-night. We’ll get out the cards if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head and sent him a strange glance,
as though wondering if he would understand. “It
isn’t entertainment I want to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what? I’m not in a position to offer much
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. It’s something like protection,
but not quite that, either. I know it sounds absurd,
but it’s the kind of thing that could only come from
one who does not believe what you do about all this.”
She made a gesture at the surrounding room. “I
suppose it’s a sort of companion in my incredulity.
You’re beginning to make things rather too much
alive for my comfort, though I don’t believe in them
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing here,” he protested quickly,
“nothing but ourselves. Forget what I said. I was
only dreaming aloud. It’s what the Scotch call havering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as he spoke there came to him the refutation
of his own words. Millicent signaled his disapproval
from the canvas overhead, and stinging whispers from
the silence around proclaimed him false to his real
belief. The protest died on his lips, and Edith looked
at him keenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want you to say what you don’t believe
in the hope of stiffening me, but I’d be glad if you’d
help to prevent my believing it, too. I don’t want to,
and I don’t intend to. I’m tremendously in earnest
about all this. The reason is that I know I haven’t
got the right kind of mental machinery. It would
break me all up, while on the contrary it is perfectly
natural for you. All I want to do is to carry on here
in the ordinary way and make it as easy as possible
for you to work. That’s a woman’s job, Jack, and
I’m satisfied with it and don’t want to go beyond it.
If there’s anything that you’re forced to tell me, well,
tell me, but don’t do any more. All this may sound
rather hysterical, but it isn’t; and it’s because I know
myself better than I begin to think I know you, even
after all these years. So don’t try me more than you
can avoid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While she was speaking, Perkins entered as silently
as before. Edith steadied herself, wondering how
much the woman had heard. She took the handkerchief
and made an indefinite gesture to her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Perkins,” he put in, “this garden is running
wild, and I’ve got to get some one at once or there’ll
be nothing worth while in the summer. Do you know
of any good man in the neighborhood?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry; I don’t, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about the village? Any chance there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say, sir. I haven’t been to the village for
more than a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Thursby’s man seems to have been very capable.
Think you could find him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know where he is, sir. He came once a
week for the past year, but left the village about a
month ago. There’s been no one since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Mr. Thursby take over Mr. Millicent’s man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.” Perkins’s expression changed ever so
slightly. “He could not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because Martin, Mr. Millicent’s man, had already
left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?” said Derrick curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three days after Mr. Millicent died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith gave an involuntary shiver. “Why should
he do that so soon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins glanced at the portrait with a kind of mute
unconsciousness. “I cannot say, madam. Martin
did not tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s more or less understandable,” hazarded Derrick;
“probably Mrs. Millicent let him go. She
wasn’t keeping on the place anyway. Do you happen
to know where he went, Perkins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith looked up. “Does that matter, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think so. The man’s reputation for roses
spread all over the county, and I’d like to get him back
if we could afford it. And it’s better to have some
one who knows the ground, if possible. What about
him, Perkins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one has heard of him from that day, as yet,
sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith got up with unmistakable decision. She was
evidently feeling herself again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Jack. Perkins, please bring my hot
water now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick followed her with his eyes but said nothing.
When he was alone, he seated himself again at his desk
and looked musingly at his manuscript. How thin
and unprofitable was all he had written, these doings
of characters so obviously fictitious, so utterly divorced
from the stinging realities of life. They saw little
and felt less, being framed in paper and not flesh and
blood. His long hand stole to the edge of the desk,
avoiding that discolored patch, and clasped the solid
frame as though to draw from it something like real
inspiration. He now touched the shadow of Millicent’s
life-blood. His glance traveled then automatically
to the portrait. Blood and paint! Between them
they held the key of mystery. He scanned the composed
features, feeling that the essence of what had
once been Millicent was close by. Then it came to him
that this essence of the murdered man had its own
part to play and was no doubt playing it at this very
moment, moving in mysterious channels and in league
with mysterious powers. Recurrent and voiceless
questions crowded upon him. What could Millicent
mean to Perkins, that lank woman with the forbidding
eyes? It seemed after a few moments that the
painted lips quivered and tried to speak, and the quiet
gaze took on something more than the mere flicker of
firelight. What was it that Millicent was trying to
convey?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you absorbed?” murmured Derrick,
half aloud. “What is it you would tell me? You suffered
here death and the fear that was perhaps worse
than death, but why did you pay the price?” He began
to write unconsciously, capturing the words as
they came; strange words, unlinked with anything that
had gone before, but pregnant with clouded suggestion.
“You believed as I do that we are not the
masters of things, but that each of us builds up
around him invisible towers of influence, by which in
time we are dominated. We store the air with records
that the air cannot discard or obliterate, eloquent—yet
having no voice; strong—yet casting no shadow.
And behind it all are Things. We cry for them as
children, and when the end comes it is hard to let
them go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was staring, puzzled, at what he had written,
when Perkins came in, her face grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, sir, the gardener is here.” Her
voice was a little breathless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What gardener? I thought you told me just a
moment ago that you knew of no one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Mr. Millicent’s gardener,” she replied steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man who has not been heard of for two
years?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. He has just returned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick took a long breath. “What brings him
back now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He regretted the question as soon as it was asked,
for Perkins was regarding him as though wondering
why he should be surprised. It was all part of something
else, something bigger. Surely he must realize
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know, sir. He only reached the village
this evening and came straight here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he expect me to engage him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would like to come back to his old place, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How extraordinary!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Derrick spoke too hastily, and again he regretted
it. Perkins did not answer. She stood passively,
an austere expression on her sallow features;
and, scrutinize as he might, there was no penetrating
the veil that enshrouded her. She was an embodiment
of something that defied his keenest analysis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where has this man been for the past two years?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did not say, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can tell me whether he was satisfactory in
every way to Mr. Millicent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded. “Mr. Millicent used to say that he
was the best gardener in the county.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick paused. “Perkins, I’m going to ask you
another question, but you need not answer unless you
like to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will tell you anything I know, sir.” She spoke
steadily and without a trace of surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then from all you know, and I refer to more than
his ability as a gardener, do you think it would be a
good thing to take him on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you put it that way, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I leave that to you. The matter may be more important
than one can realize—as yet.” He lingered a
little over the last words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, yes, sir, if you want a garden like Mr.
Millicent’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shrewdness of the answer took him aback.
“Send him in,” he said shortly.</p>

<hr class='tbk100'/>

<p class='pindent'>The man entered, the man whose dark features had
peered through the parted curtains a short hour before.
He was powerfully built, very broad, and dressed in
loose and much worn tweeds of a foreign cut. He
came forward with the lurching walk of a seafaring
trade, a colored handkerchief twisted round the column
of his brown neck. His swinging hands were
wide and knotted, and every motion spoke of great
physical strength. No mere Sussex gardener this,
who had spent his placid years among his roses and
dahlias, but one who carried with him nameless suggestions
of the jungle and the faint pounding of distant
surf. Dangling his cap, he gave a sort of salute,
making at the same time a swift survey of the room.
From this furtive and searching glance it seemed to
Derrick that the man missed something he knew of old
in Millicent’s time, but no flicker of change of expression
could be discerned on the weather-beaten face.
The face itself was neither cruel nor merciless but
conveyed a grim, implacable resolution. Here, reflected
Derrick, was the man who disappeared three
days after Millicent’s death. What brought him back
now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin, sir, John Martin.” The voice was deep
and husky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perkins tells me you were in Mr. Millicent’s service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, for some years after his last trip to the
East.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you come from the East with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, I—I was engaged here at Beech Lodge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Several years service, yet you left three days after
your employer died?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin jerked up his head. “Yes, sir; that’s it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you happen to go so quickly? Were you
discharged by Mrs. Millicent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dull flush rose in the tanned face. “You might
as well ask how my master happened to die three days
before I left, sir. Mrs. Millicent was giving up Beech
Lodge and didn’t want a gardener. There was no
other job in sight about here, and I couldn’t afford to
hang on in the village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded with seeming carelessness. “Perhaps
that’s fair enough, and as it happens I do want a
gardener, but you’ll have to satisfy me completely
on all points before I consider you. The circumstances
are a bit out of the ordinary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m ready to tell you anything I can, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then where do you come from now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upper Burma, by way of Canada. I have a sister
in Alberta.” He fumbled in his pocket. “Would you
be wanting to see my passport?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now, at any rate. I don’t understand why you
should clear out of Sussex for Burma just because
there was no job close at hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, to tell the truth, I was that upset I
wanted to get away as far as possible. I couldn’t
put the master out of my head. He’d always been
good to me from the first day I came, and we liked the
same things, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shot this out with rumbling assurance, and,
strange as it sounded, Derrick believed him. It was
difficult to picture this great hulk among the roses,
these thick fingers training the delicate buds, but Martin’s
reputation had already been established far beyond
Beech Lodge. There had been, too, an assuring
little break in the voice, suggesting a depth of feeling
in strange contrast to this forbidding exterior.
If this was acting, it was good acting. He scanned
the man’s face, but as for promising any future revelations
it was no more expressive than that of Perkins
herself. Anything might lie hidden here. There
were hints of passion in the eyes, but over him rested
the touch of a complete control. If one could only
get underneath that! It was obvious to Derrick that
he must act deliberately—and delicately. It would be
a matter of weeks, or perhaps months. The strangeness
of the situation came over him with redoubled
force. It was all part of a plan. Whose plan?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is it, Martin, if you can tell me, that after
two years on the other side of the world you turn up
here within a week or so of my coming? There has
been no job going for all that time, but you arrive as
soon as the job, your old one, is open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin scratched his head and seemed genuinely
puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dunno, sir. It’s queer to me, too, but here I am.
I didn’t know there was a job open till a few minutes
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take it, then, you had no particular reason for
getting back here to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man glanced at him with a sort of awkward
interest. He hesitated a little, as though about to put
forward something hardly credible even to himself,
and finally jerked out an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say much more than that things kind of
hinted at it, sir, and kept on hinting till they made me
uncomfortable. There wasn’t any special reason I
know of. I was doing well enough, trading up the
Irawadi, when something began to get at me to come
back, and it kept on till I started for Rangoon. It
stayed with me, hustling me along, and I felt I didn’t
even want to go and look up my sister; but I did, and
the same feeling lifted me out of their farm in Alberta.
Up till about two months ago I believed I wasn’t
wanted here; then I knew I was wanted for something.”
He frowned to himself at this, as though he
hardly expected to be either understood or taken seriously.
“Maybe I was a fool to come,” he added, “but
in a way it wasn’t left to me to decide. It’s the first
time I ever struck anything like that. It was like
jungle-fever without the fever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You simply had to come,” said Derrick quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not given to such feelings, but, since you say
it, yes, I reckon I had to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick had a faint thrill of triumph. Here again
the mysterious factor was at work, the thing to which
he himself was yielding so completely. It had spread
its potent and invisible filaments half round the world,
penetrated the Burmese jungle, and haled this shifty-eyed
man back to the tiny Sussex village from which
he had fled under the shadow of a great crime as yet
undetected. How could these filaments have been set
in motion if not at the demand of the dead Millicent
whose quiet features now surveyed this recaptured
wanderer? What would the thing that had been Millicent
arrange next? At the thought of this Derrick’s
pulse gave a throb of excitement. Then he looked
Martin full in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who found your master?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man dropped his cap, and all the blood in his
body seemed to climb to his temples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Perkins found him,” he said jerkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did she find him?” If Martin had lied
the fact would come out now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin pointed to the desk. “Where you are sitting,
Mr. Derrick. He was leaning forward, his head
on one side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, but not long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What had happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stabbed in the neck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And no trace of what killed him has ever been
found?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing that I ever heard of.” Martin moved
a little impatiently, but Derrick’s voice was very even.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you were at the inquest? These are
some of the things you need not answer, unless you’re
determined to get that job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I was there”—this with a defiant glance—“and
they examined me, and when it was over not a
man had a word to say against me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick sharpened his tone. “Your master is just
behind you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man started violently and made a harsh noise
in his throat. He turned slowly and unwillingly, forcing
himself inch by inch, till, following Derrick’s gaze
he saw the portrait. At that his color changed, his face
becoming overcast with anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God, but you frightened me,” he said thickly.
“I didn’t know what you meant—thought it was a
ghost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a good likeness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin breathed deeply and pulled himself together
stretching his fingers with a slow gesture of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s him all right, but he looked older, a
good deal older toward the end. Something like you,
sir, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where were you at the time it happened? Can
you tell me exactly, and what you were doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dark face grew threatening. “Is this another
inquest, Mr. Derrick? I came here to try and get
my old job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can drop it if you like, Martin, or else answer
my questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the man truculently, “I was smoking
in that little garden beside the cottage—I lived there
then—when I heard Perkins. She was running like a
deer down from the house and calling at the top of
her voice. She was only half dressed, and I thought
she was mad, screaming about the master being killed.
I ran back with her, and found him as I told you—where
you’re sitting now. Then I ran to the village
for the doctor. When we got him here he said that
Mr. Millicent must have been dead for over an hour.
He had been struck with great force in the neck with
a dagger of some kind. And that’s all I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded, apparently satisfied. “It’s practically
what I’ve heard elsewhere.” He sat for a moment,
plunged in thought. “Wait where you are for
a moment, Martin. I want to have a word with Miss
Derrick before deciding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went out. Martin balanced himself on the edge
of his chair, listened keenly to the retreating footsteps,
heard a creak on the stair, and glanced cautiously
about. Then he got up, stole on tiptoe to the door,
and put his ear to the keyhole. Satisfied that he was
secure, he crept noiselessly across the floor, darting
a look at the portrait as he went, and halted stiffly
beside the big desk. Here his hands became intensely
busy, his thick fingers passing swiftly over the carved
frame, like those of a blind man. One particular spot
he explored with strained attention, turning his massive
head every few seconds toward the door, his whole
body keyed to the utmost nervous pitch. He had
his back to the French window, and the lamp cast
his gigantic shadow on the ceiling, where its distorted
shadow quivered like that of a brooding giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But from the window another pair of eyes surveyed
this silent drama. Once again the curtains had parted
slightly some five feet above the floor, and, from the
gap so lately tenanted by Martin’s threatening mask,
Derrick now watched every move. This was what he
sought, this opportunity, but what had guided him to
his vantage-point he could not tell. He had remembered
that the window was unfastened. He believed
that the curtain would keep him safe from discovery,
because he was assured that his strange visitor had
come to stay and not to steal. To observe Martin
when Martin thought himself unobserved, in that direction
might lie knowledge. But what was it Martin
sought now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scrutiny lasted but a few seconds. The gardener
was back in his seat when Derrick entered unconcernedly,
resumed his seat at the desk, and lit his
pipe with extreme deliberation. Martin’s face was
utterly blank, and he got up automatically when the
new master of Beech Lodge came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want that job, I’m inclined to give it to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big chest expanded slowly, and the broad figure
lost something of its rigidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir, and I’ll do my very best,” said
Martin eagerly. “I know the place like a book, and
I know roses, and you won’t have reason to regret it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick smiled. “We haven’t discussed the matter
of wages yet.” He was wondering whether the rate
of pay meant as little to this man as it had to Perkins.
“What I’m going to offer won’t seem much to one
who has knocked about the world as much as yourself.
It’s not a case of American wages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not worrying about wages, sir. It doesn’t
take much to keep me going, and I’ve never had a
drink in my life. It’s the old job I’m after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what do you say to thirty shillings a week
and the cottage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s fair enough,” said Martin eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, I take it you’re not married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t any wife now,” he stammered after a
poignant pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, Martin, I didn’t mean to hurt you. Any
children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.” The tanned face was calm again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I suppose you can begin to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m ready for that.” Martin fingered his cap.
“Might I sleep in the cottage to-night, sir? I’ve got
my bundle outside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said this without any seeming thought of the
inference Derrick must draw, an inference that the
latter jumped at. Why bring a bundle before one was
sure of a job? But perhaps, and here a message
drifted in from the paneled walls, perhaps it was
already arranged that Martin should get the job, and
the man in some queer way was aware of that. And,
after all, why should he part from his bundle? He
would have slept with it under a hedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick felt in his pocket. “Perhaps you’d better
stop in the village to-night, and clean up the cottage
to-morrow. It must be cold and damp. Got enough
money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin gave a twisted smile. “Yes, sir, I have
money, but if you don’t mind I’ll risk the damp. It’s
nothing to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, let it stand till to-morrow; then you can move
in. I’ll see you about ten o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rang the bell, Martin standing motionless, a
baffling expression on his face. He had secured what
he came for but still seemed ill at ease and uncontent.
Then Perkins entered like a sallow ghost, and Derrick,
regarding these two, experienced a novel sensation
at seeing them stand side by side, the staff of Beech
Lodge, the depositories of the secret of the house.
Between them lay the thing he pursued, or that pursued
him. They did not look at each other, but waited,
silent, impassive, and remote. He wondered what it
would be that first broke through the surface of this
extraordinary calm, so profound as to be already ominous.
But that would come in its appointed cycle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perkins, I have engaged Martin as gardener. He
will commence work in the morning, occupy the cottage,
and do for himself entirely. Did you do anything
in the house before, Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boots and coals, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t need any help now, sir,” put in Perkins
swiftly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s lids flickered, but he did not stir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then for the meantime, Martin, stick to outside
work. All right, you may go now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man mumbled good night, made his former
awkward salute, and marched into the hall. He did
not glance at the woman, nor she at him. Derrick’s
eyes narrowed a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please come here, Perkins, when you’ve locked
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door closed, and he looked instinctively at the
portrait as though to ask whether in all this he had
done the right thing. But Millicent was uncommunicative
to-night. Quite deliberately Derrick was rebuilding
the personnel of Beech Lodge as it existed
two years before, peopling it with the same faces,
making it echo with the same voices. Its one-time
master was no doubt still here, and now there remained
only the other Millicents. If the circle could but be
closed, and old contacts reëstablished, then perhaps the
way would become clear. He was deliberating this
when Perkins’s return ended the reverie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like, if possible, to feel sure, Perkins, that
from all you know of Martin I’ve done the right thing
in engaging him. This unexpected return is bound to
affect you in some way under the circumstances,
and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped abruptly. She was staring at him with
so searching an expression that he knew that to-night
he had drawn nearer the essential mystery of Beech
Lodge. Yet it was not his action but his words that
produced this remarkable effect. He was aware that
it was not in the garden, where Millicent had lovingly
tended his roses, or anywhere but in this room that
the spirit of the murdered man seemed to cry aloud
for vengeance—and for peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was meant that Martin should come back and
you should engage him,” said Perkins dully. “I do
not know more than that. You could not help it.
You were called, and Martin, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He perceived that there was nothing absurd in this.
She spoke simply, as though reciting facts established
beyond all question. Her look told him that at this
moment she could go no further. Suddenly something
reached him out of space. The room was alive again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long had Mr. Millicent been dead when you
found him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you that they sent for me,” she answered
gravely, “but I do not know how soon they sent.
When the doctor came he thought that it had happened
more than an hour before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you found him at this desk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Martin say that?” she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it matter who said it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her thin hands clasped over her breast. There was
a look in her face he had never seen there before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it matters a great deal if it was Martin.
Were you and he long in this room together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said tremulously, “only a moment, but
he stayed there after the doctor came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick’s voice, which in spite of himself had risen
a little, now dropped to a more level pitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And in spite of all this nothing of any importance
seems to have disappeared. Even his papers were undisturbed,
so it was not burglary. He had no enemies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was not that kind. All liked him who knew
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you have nothing to say or suggest as to any
possible motive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not answer but seemed to withdraw lest
he unearth more than she was prepared to reveal.
This suggested that it was now for him to follow the
trail alone—if he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it hard to get that stain reduced?” He flung
the question at her like a missile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins winced visibly, glancing first at him, then
at the desk as though its massive surface had found
accusing speech. Her breath came faster, and Derrick
knew that he had moved a step nearer the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are there no secrets from you?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it was not always there,” he continued
meaningly, “but returned after I came here. My
fingers found it first, and it spoke. Soon after that I
began to understand. The inventory man saw it before
I did but got nothing from it. Perhaps Martin
found it, too, when I was out of the room. I hoped
he would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded uncertainly, as one blinded by a sudden
vision, then moved unsteadily to the desk and stood
looking down at the faint, irregular patch. She put
out a hand, lean and claw-like, forcing herself to touch
the discolored leather. Leaning over it, her eyes dark
with unfathomable things, she relived something in that
moment; but it was hidden too deep for discovery.
Finally she spoke, as though to some one far distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it always this way? Is the whole world full
of stains like this, stains that go deeper and deeper,
however we try to rub them out, till by and by we
cannot reach them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some stains are never effaced,” said Derrick
grimly. “We only rub them deeper in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Martin is here to-night!” The words came
from her very soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin is probably in the cottage at this moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he said he was going to the village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick reached for his pipe. “Yes, that’s what I
told him, but now I think he’s in the cottage. He
does not want to go further from the house than that.
I don’t know why, but I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sent him a look like that of an animal in a trap
and left the room. Derrick sucked at his pipe, pitching
his mind back over the last half-hour, piecing together
fragment after fragment of evidence, but groping
in vain for some underlying fact. Incident and
strange coincident, shuffle them as he might, they made
no decipherable pattern. Then, as happened so often,
his eyes wandered to the portrait of Millicent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it all right,” he said, half aloud, “you whom I
have never seen? You know why I am trying, but
I do not. It’s all clear on your side, but misty on
mine. Is it only for a little longer, till you find
rest and sleep—for till then will there be no peace for
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack,” sounded a voice at the door, “who on earth
are you talking to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started and laughed awkwardly. “Come in,
Edith; I thought you were asleep long ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t get to sleep, so thought I would come
and see you. Why this oration to an empty room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hooked his arm into hers, led her across, and
halted under the portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to help me do something for that
chap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him regretfully. “There’s no reason
in you at all, and just when I had persuaded myself
that everything was all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I admit it sounds ridiculous, but really it’s not. I
was never more serious in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can you do anything for a dead man you
never knew?” She glanced keenly about the room.
“Do you remember our last talk, the one we had just
after we got here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, every word of it. And I’m not going to try
you now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put a hand on his arm. “It isn’t myself, Jack;
it’s you. I’m all right, except that I blame myself for
having been rather silly. But I know perfectly well
that nothing has been natural since we came here, especially
yourself. Things seem to be settled in the
ordinary way; then you make me feel they’re not
settled, and you, my dear brother, are drifting about as
you never have before. What is it? If I knew, perhaps
I might help. Really I don’t understand, and in
a queer way we don’t seem to be living for ourselves
any longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he countered, “I’m not altogether unpractical.
For instance, I think I’ve got hold of a first-rate
gardener.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he has just gone. I took him on, and he
starts to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She brightened at that and went off after begging
him not to sit up too late. Derrick went back to his
desk, feeling suddenly a little weary. The singing
silence reasserted itself, and the fire was low. He endeavored
to work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he looked up sharply and caught his breath.
There was a distinct tapping at the French window.
He had a novel sensation of fear. The sound continued
with a sort of regular and tiny beat. He got
up slowly, and drew aside the curtain. The window
was not locked. Through the glass he saw the peaked
cap, red face, and brass buttons of a gigantic policeman.
The man made a reassuring salute, and Derrick
opened the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beg pardon, sir, for not going to the front door,
but I saw you were alone and didn’t want to wake the
whole house. There’s no other light anywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, officer, but you gave me a bit of a start.
What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m on patrol, sir, passing here twice every night.
I usually take a stroll round the house and cottage to
see that all is as it should be, and just now, when I was
at the back of the cottage, I noticed a light inside.
That surprised me, as I knew it had not been occupied
since Mr. Thursby left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s quite right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, there’s a man there now. Is that with
your permission?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick’s pulse beat a little faster. “What sort of
a man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Middle-aged, sir, queer face, queer clothes, sitting
on a chair and staring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At nothing, sir, so far as I could make out. A
thick-set party, his skin burned and brown as though
he’d come off the sea. Black hair, he has, and big
hands and odd eyes that never stirred. It was the
eyes that took me. He’s an ugly-looking customer
all round, sir, but I thought I’d better see you before
I pulled him in, just in case. What puzzled me was
the lamp being lit and the blind up, if he’d no right to
be there. There, was a bundle on the floor beside
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you came in first. How long have you
been on duty in the village?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Matter of a year and a half now, sir. I was
transferred here just about the time Mr. Thursby left
Beech Lodge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve been here a little more than a week.
You knew, of course, that this was Mr. Millicent’s
house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, we all know that. There wasn’t much
chance of forgetting it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t suppose you personally know anything
about his death—or murder, if you like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The constable shook his head. “I know what the
rest of the force knows, and I’ve read the evidence
at the inquest. But there wasn’t anything dug up
then that was of any real use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded. “I had heard nothing of it up to
a week ago, not even a whisper when I leased this
house last month. Now I’m beginning to feel as
though I’d known it all my life. What does the sergeant
think about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not supposed to say anything about what’s
not my duty, sir,” replied the man a trifle stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re probably right there; is this the first time
you’ve been in this room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The constable looked ponderously about, his eyes
glinting at sight of the desk. He knew what had happened
there. Then at the portrait, with a hard stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, first time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever been in the house at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, never crossed the door-step.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you know that Mr. Millicent was found
dead at this desk with a stab in his neck? That’s
him above the mantel. They say it’s very like him
and, oddly, something like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was told about that, sir. A harmless-looking
gentleman, I should say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’ll probably remember that the only person
on whom suspicion really fell was Mr. Millicent’s
gardener. I think that’s common knowledge, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, it is, but he cleared himself somehow,
got out of the country, and hasn’t been seen since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Derrick slowly, “that’s the man you
found in the cottage, the late gardener of Beech Lodge,
and I’ve engaged him to work for me. Can you guess
why, constable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The policeman’s mouth opened wide. “But he’s
the one who the sergeant thinks—” He broke off
confusedly, while over his face spread a look of dawning
astonishment and admiration. “By George, sir,
but you’ve done a bold thing, and there’s not many
would have done it. Perhaps you’re on the right
track. But what brought the fellow here again into the
middle of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick smiled grimly. “Now you’re asking too
much. We haven’t come to that yet, and there’s no
immediate hurry. Main thing is, he’s here and settled
for the present. That gives one time to think.
As for my end of it, I may be on the right track, and I
may not. At any rate, I’m going to make a push for
it. So far, I’m trying to piece some of the bits together,
and Martin’s arrival is one of them. There’s
bound to be a good deal more. So don’t disturb our
friend in the cottage, for I fancy he’ll be rather badly
needed. And, look here, do you think the sergeant will
be willing to have a talk about this matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re on the track of the man who killed Mr.
Millicent, the sergeant would walk twenty miles to
see you. I think he dreams about that case every
night. It’s a sort of reflection on the police force of
Bamberley. It hurts him. That’s the way he feels
still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! But perhaps it would be better if I went
to see him. I’ll do that within the next few weeks.
Meantime do you have to report this visit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only that the cottage is occupied with your authority.
That takes it off our special list of empty buildings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d be glad if it went no further than that, and the
sergeant will agree with me there. Good night,
officer. I shall sleep peacefully now, thanks to you.
You can’t take a drink, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man smiled ruefully. “No, sir; thanks
just the same. I think you’ll be a welcome visitor at
the station. Good night, and I’ll slip past the cottage
without disturbing our friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saluted, the French window closed behind him
without a sound, and his great bulk melted into the
darkness.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch4'>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>JEAN</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>OME TWO weeks after the staff of Beech Lodge
had been completed by the engagement of the
gardener, Mrs. Millicent and her daughter were
walking along a quiet lane at a little distance from
their old home. The house itself they had not seen
since the time of the tragedy, and over them still
hung the weight of a great grief. It had touched
Mrs. Millicent’s hair with gray and given her a
strangely wistful expression. Her sorrow was increased
by the belief that her husband had had an
enemy, the husband who had worshiped her with love
and devotion for twenty years of married companionship.
What enemy could such a man make in all the
world?</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Jean, her daughter, the blow had been no less
severe. And it had a deeper significance. Dazed and
stupefied, she was nevertheless aware of the power behind
the blow, the power that dealt it. Where her
mother was inclined to give way with a hopeless wonder
at the cruelty of fate, Jean perceived that the hand
that thus struck the helpless might not have been
stayed by her father’s blood. If her father were in
the way of something—she knew not what—might
there not be others similarly threatened? The resiliency
of her youth refused merely to accept the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to a fork in the lane, one turn of which
led past Beech Lodge and then on to their own small
house. Mrs. Millicent took the other turn instinctively,
but Jean, for some reason she could never explain,
felt a sudden impulse to pass this time by the
road they had both hitherto avoided. She stopped,
and her mother glanced back with surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, mother, but”—she hesitated—“I
rather want to go this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell you, really. It’s rather an odd feeling.
Would you much sooner not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It flashed into Mrs. Millicent’s mind that perhaps
she had been unwise in allowing her own shrinking
timidity to influence the girl. The only reason she
had to put forward sounded a little too personal to
carry much weight, and if time was healing the wound
in Jean’s heart, should she not be thankful—and show
it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, dear,” she said slowly. “Perhaps it
is better to begin this way. I think I’d like your
arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went on thus, with unvoiced recognition of
remembered things. Came the bend in the lane beyond
which lay Beech Lodge, and the older woman
seemed to feel the knife in her own throat. So many
times had she walked here, and so happily. The dip
in the hedge, the glimpse of rolling fields patched with
woodland, the belt of timber that marked the grounds
of Beech Lodge, the cluster of old trees with their
pale gray trunks close by the roadside; then the white
gates and tiny red-roofed cottage. Her fingers tightened
on the girl’s strong arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, my dear,” she whispered. “Just two
years ago!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean nodded sympathetically but did not speak.
She was staring up the drive at the house with its
shining windows, its clustering ivy, and the wide door,
in every timber of which seemed to be a welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it strange?” she whispered. “So different,
and yet so unchanged.” She paused, then went on
uncertainly. “I sometimes wonder, mother, whether
houses have some kind of consciousness and are aware
of us who live in them. Isn’t it queer, but I feel now
as though Beech Lodge was somehow glad to see us,
and was wondering why we had never come before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Millicent shook her head. “It’s a pretty
fancy, child, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean stopped, nearly opposite the white gates.
“Who’s that at the window—your old room?
Mother, it looks like Perkins!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Perkins. You knew she stayed on when
the Thursbys left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I did not know she was still here. And
yet I’m not surprised. She’s part of the house. I
wonder if the Derricks like her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She always had a very peculiar manner, but she
was an excellent servant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Millicent’s voice faltered. This inspection was
becoming too poignant, and she moved on. It seemed
that any moment there might emerge that well-remembered
figure, with the straight, familiar form
and those clear, thoughtful eyes. She had turned
away, her lips trembling, when Jean spoke quickly and
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, who is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the climbing rose-bushes that bordered the
wide drive, a figure had emerged, shears in hand, a
figure that halted and stared. The broad shoulders,
the uncouth head, the powerful and deliberate movements
of the man were unmistakable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!” she said under her breath. “It’s Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Millicent stopped, turned, and came unsteadily
back. Then she too looked, and became weak and
agitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span> Martin—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where can he have come from, and why come
back here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment her mother could not answer, being
too shaken by this quivering recognition of one who
she felt held the key to her husband’s tragic death.
It was Martin who had moved with threatening domination
through the nightmare of her dreams for the
last two years. Now the threat was alive again. It
had returned with him. Then she heard Jean. The
color had fled from the girl’s cheeks, but her eyes were
alight with some thrilling instinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it mean, mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know, child. Come away now, please; I
must get home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean held back. Something more was stirring in
her soul than Martin’s return. He had come back to
strangers who probably knew nothing of him. If they
did, he could not be at Beech Lodge. And Perkins was
there, too, and Perkins knew all. It followed, then,
that the woman had not spoken. Was it all in preparation
for another tragedy? At this thought she felt
frightened and choked. Some one must speak—before
speech was too late. She glanced again at the
motionless figure. Martin was staring, too, and he
also had recognized. He touched his cap, and at the
curve of that arm she nearly cried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother,” she whispered again, “we must tell
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell them what, Jean? Come along. I can’t
stand this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl held her ground. “We must tell the Derricks
about Martin. Don’t you see it would be utterly
unfair, and perhaps cowardly, if we didn’t? They’ve
taken the place and, being strangers, can have known
very little about it. They have probably heard about
father’s death through Perkins, but perhaps not. The
agent would naturally say nothing about it, and I don’t
suppose the Thursbys would advertise the truth. Perkins
has evidently said nothing about Martin, or the
Derricks would not have engaged him. We know all,
and the suspicions as to Martin, and we simply cannot
be silent. Oh, we must tell them, and now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you feel so strongly I’ll write to-night,” protested
her mother faintly, “but, Jean, I cannot go in
now. I could not walk past that man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl was unmoved. “That won’t do, mother.
There are too many things one can’t put on paper.
One of us must speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot make myself speak now, and you can’t
go in there alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Martin looking at you. He knows what
we are talking about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he does, and if so he’s more afraid of me
than I am of him. At any rate I must go. You keep
on toward the village, and I’ll catch you up. If I
have to wait I’ll have some one walk home with me.
And please, please understand that I’m not afraid,
because there’s nothing to fear. I know now why we
came this way to-day for the first time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Millicent sighed despairingly and turned away.
There was a look on the girl’s face she could not meet,
and Martin had not moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean rallied her courage, passed between the white
gates, and walked firmly up the drive. Martin saw
her coming and stepped back till he was half screened
among his roses. His face was working. When she
drew level he touched his cap the second time, and for
an instant their eyes met. In hers there was a cold
recognition; in his a sort of mute and restless petition.
Yes, he knew why she had come and what she was
about to impart to his new employer. A surge of impotent
anger shot through him, and he turned silently
lest he should betray it. He had not reckoned on this
when in the Burmese jungle there reached him the first
of those discomforting promptings that finally brought
him half-way round the world, he knew not why.
Jean did not look back. Her eyes were fixed on the
too familiar door. It opened almost at once, and
she met the changeless look of Perkins. Now she
could speak, but the sight of the hall, its rugs and pictures,
all as though she had never left them, was
nearly too much. They were as unchanged as Perkins
herself. Suddenly she felt like an intruder or a
thief and wanted to leave. At that she remembered
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon, Perkins. Is Mrs. Derrick in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no Mrs. Derrick, miss. It’s Mr. Derrick’s
sister who is here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is she in, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, miss, but Mr. Derrick is here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’d like to see him for a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you wait in the living-room, miss? Mr.
Derrick is working in the study.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, I’ll wait here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins tapped at the study door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Millicent, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick put down his pen. “Miss Millicent,” he
repeated puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is waiting in the hall and would like to see
you. She asked for Miss Derrick first, but Miss Derrick
is out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up, his pulse beating hard, and came quickly
into the hall. They glanced at each other, these two,
drawn thus together by the shadow of a crime. Instinctively
she held out her hand, feeling for a strange
moment almost as though no introduction was necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, Miss Millicent? My sister will
be very sorry to miss you. Will you come into the
living-room or”—he hesitated an instant—“the
study?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t keep you a moment,” she said a little nervously.
“Are you working in the study?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded, smiling. “I think it’s a wonderful
room. Please come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He followed her in, while Perkins, after a lingering
glance, closed the door. Jean took a big chair by the
fireplace, and for a moment neither spoke. Then she
saw the manuscript littering the desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so afraid I’ve interrupted you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head ruefully. “What I was writing,
or trying to write, is all the better for being interrupted.
And,” he added, “we have been hoping to
meet you and your mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again their eyes met. Derrick noted the smooth
oval of her face and the sensitive curve of her lips.
Her expression suggested imagination, a mind at once
alert and subjective. She was looking now at her
father’s portrait, and he saw the resemblance between
these two. And, try as he might, he could not guess
her thoughts or what brought her there. But something
whispered that a Millicent was again in Beech
Lodge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not know I was coming here to-day,” she said
gravely, “not till mother and I came past the gates.
Then I knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all so strange, and yet so utterly real, that
Derrick did not answer at once. Here was Millicent’s
daughter in Millicent’s study. That to begin with.
And there was about the girl a nameless aura she had
brought with her that made the ordinary preliminaries
of acquaintance seem pointless and out of place. He
did not feel that he had always known her, but that
somewhere and somehow they possessed something in
common.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please tell me,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if I may begin by asking questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be very kind of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, did you know about Beech Lodge when you
took it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; that is, if I understand what you mean. I
was looking for a quiet place to work in, found this,
and fell in love with it. I went straight to the agent
in London and made an offer. He telephoned to Mr.
Thursby, and the offer was accepted so quickly that
it surprised me—and here we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Perkins who showed you over the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she was alone here, and in charge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the rest?” She glanced at him as though
counting on his intuition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I discovered that after we moved in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry,” she said involuntarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why, Miss Millicent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I’m sure you would not—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped abruptly. A whisper came to her that
she was saying things of which she was not quite sure.
What if Beech Lodge had imparted the edge of its
secret, the secret of which she had long been conscious,
to its new tenant? His face was that of one who
might be able to receive such things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were going to tell me that if I had known
what happened here two years ago I would not have
taken the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded thankfully. Yes, he did understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then may I say that I think I realize what it must
have meant to you to come in here for that purpose?
And, Miss Millicent, while I did not know at the time,
I do know now, and regret nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing?” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “Nothing. Shall I go on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded again and, lifting her eyes, took a long
straight look at her father’s portrait. Perhaps he was
here now, and knew, and was in a way glad she had
come. She noted, too, with a sort of thankfulness
that Derrick did not sit at the desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I came first,” he continued, “I saw Perkins.
She gave me a strange impression, but it was not altogether
discomforting. I took the house without consulting
my sister, being attracted to it in a way that
I only began to understand by degrees. I actually felt
what had happened here before being told about it.
That isn’t the sort of thing one can explain, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t need explanation,” she put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sent her a quick, searching glance. “It helps to
have you say that. Well, after we moved in, the
thing, or perhaps it was the influence, grew stronger—I
can’t express it in any other way—till presently I
was sure we were meant to come. I got some details
from Perkins, but they were incomplete; I was convinced
that I must wait for more—which would certainly
be furnished from some source.” He paused,
reflected for a moment, and went on rapidly. “Does
it seem impertinent for me, an utter stranger, to be
so interested and allow myself to be drawn into something
which is not my affair? If it does, I can only
assure you that it is not curiosity, or,” he added
thoughtfully, “the result of anything I have done or
said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible to think that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you see it that way, because it brings me
to Martin. Is it on account of Martin you were kind
enough to come in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, some day, if you or Mrs. Millicent will tell
me, I’d like to hear more about him; but meantime
please be assured that Martin’s being here is all part of
the rest of it. I knew what was said and thought about
him when I took him on. He told me why he happened
to come back at this particular time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why was it?” asked Jean swiftly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>had</span> to come. Telling you that seems to explain
a good many other things one can’t very well
put into words. I know now that Perkins had to
stay, that I had to take this house, that you had to pass
this way for the first time in many months; and I
know, too, that the gathering is not yet quite complete.
It is all utterly intangible; there is no one point on
which one can put a finger and say the reason lies
there; and one of the most remarkable things is that
we can meet for the first time and talk like this. It
is something more than fate; it is purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him wonderingly. The room, with
its poignant memories, was speaking to her now, its
ancient walls vibrant with mystical messages. Here
was the sounding-box of the unknown, where in times
past she had thrilled to mysterious whispers. Here
her father had sat—himself even, with all his love,
something of a mystery—and here at the end his life
had been snatched from him. What reason was there
to assume that evil and danger had passed away?
And till it did pass the tale could not be complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not going to try and thank you,” she said
slowly, “for having made my coming here so much
easier than it promised to be, but when I saw Martin
I knew what I had to do. Mother was with me, but
she could not face it and has gone on to the village.
Martin looked at me as I came in and knows why I
came. He must know that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you and your mother feel more comfortable
if I sent Martin away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you must not do that. We are in no danger
from him. I mean you must not do it on our account.
But there’s your sister and yourself to think of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “I am convinced that this need
not trouble you. The police know of the new arrangement,
and Martin knows that they know. No danger
of the sort you mean lies there. I want to leave Martin
to his roses and Perkins to her house-work till something
I cannot describe is reëstablished. Beech Lodge
seems to be waiting for that. Perkins and Martin are
also waiting, though unconsciously. I am certainly
waiting. And, Miss Millicent, I think that without
knowing it you have been waiting, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she whispered, “it’s the only thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, may I ask something that’s rather difficult
to ask? I wouldn’t unless I believed that you too
felt something that’s very difficult to express.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please—what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hold with me that we are all surrounded by
influences we do not understand, and in so far as we
are able to interpret them the difficult things become
less threatening?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One cannot escape that,” she said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought as much. But there are some who fight
against such powers, and, believing them to be all for
evil, are frightened, they know not why. If they are
not frightened, they scout them. But since these powers
are both for good and evil, and I believe those for
good must be the strongest, it is only right to admit
that the beneficent and invisible influences are always
fighting for readjustments of some kind and will conquer
in the end. If this were not the case, what advantage
could there be in life? You believe all this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must believe it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my sister does not; she says she’s too practical,
and I do not argue the point. Unless one can
accept it, there’s no room for anything but restlessness
and probably fear. So what I’d like to suggest, if I
may, is that you do not say anything of all this to—to
any one who does—not see this as we do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean my mother?” she said quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “You told me she could not face coming
in here, but you came, and that explained much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother would not understand,” she admitted, “and
I think you’re very wise. But is there nothing else I
can do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if you will, a little later on, tell me some of
the things I would like to know. May I bring my sister
to see you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please do; we should be very glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said good-by. The ordeal she had dreaded was
over and concluded in a fashion she never anticipated.
It was all strange—and yet not strange. She was persuaded
that this interview had been dominated by
something her father had left behind, in order that it
might fight for what Derrick called readjustment.
And in that she was ready to aid to the utmost. There
was no room for fear now. She declined Derrick’s
offer to walk home with her and went thoughtfully
back with a new sense of being fortified in things that
for years past had stirred secretly in her soul.</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick sat in the study late that night, with no pretense
at work. Beech Lodge had dipped into utter silence,
and the fire was low. His mind was full of the
visitor of the afternoon, whose coming had lent a new
significance to his surroundings. Now he perceived
more clearly what it must have cost her to come. He
was conscious of her communicable courage, the charm
of her youth, and above all of the fact that to her also
something had whispered from the infinite. How
vivid she was, how understanding!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wondered, too, what impression she carried
away. Had he said too much, or too little? In talking,
as he had done, to the daughter of a murdered
man while she sat in her father’s study beneath her
father’s portrait, in taking on himself the office of
avenger—had he not already gone too far and too fast?
Could Jean Millicent have done otherwise than approve
while she must have been still struggling with profound
and reawakened emotions? Had he been stilted
and self-assured and pedantic? Had he assumed too
much? These questions harassed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Against it he put the girl’s coming. She had not
known what manner of person she would find but,
braving the revival of her own loss, had determined
to do what she could to save others from any tragic
experience. This thought grew in his mind till, in
turn, he recognized a new element in this strange affair.
He had desired to answer if he could the voiceless petitions
of the dead man, but now, in addition, he felt a
wave of protection for those whom Millicent had left
behind. It was this, he realized, that had animated
him during his talk with Jean Millicent. And she had
promised to help. He got up restlessly, lowered the
lamp, and, moving to the French window, stared out at
the moon-smitten lawn. How often must Millicent,
who was so close to-night, have stared like this? Perhaps
it was on such a night that the evil thing came,
strong and merciless. But whence and how?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the midst of a space of profound silence
that he heard the faintest click at the door. He started
at that, for his sister had been long in bed, and Perkins’s
room was in the far corner of the house. What
moved in Beech Lodge now? The door was opening,
so slowly that it was almost imperceptible. His hair
began to prickle. Was this the evil thing, and what
did it seek?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood, breathless and motionless, his pulse hammering,
till through the widening crack projected a
hand, followed by a long arm and white-clad shoulder.
The fingers were empty and extended as though feeling
blindly. Then a face, pallid as of the dead. It was
Perkins!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glided forward without sound or speech, a
wraith, a spirit of the night, so unreal, so remote as to
be divested of human attributes, the thin hand still held
out, exploring and testing the half-light that filtered
through the silent chamber. It was the hand rather
than the body that had life, with consciousness in its
quivering finger-tips. She was only partly dressed and
wore a loose white wrapper that accentuated the tall
straightness of her figure. Her black hair hung in two
thick ropes over her shoulders; her feet were bare; and
her face was that of one who sees unspeakable things.
The eyes were wide open, and in their glassy stare was
a strange hunger and a great question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came on like an uncaptured spirit, feeling delicately
along the paneled wall, a creature of body and
flesh, but directed by some mysterious influence beyond
human ken. She did not look toward the window
but paused for a moment to survey the portrait with an
unearthly and profound recognition. From this she
turned to the desk, leaning over it, her dangling ropes
of hair rendered semi-luminous against the lamp, peering,
peering, till at length the long, questing fingers
found what they sought, and poised, quivering above
the stain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now she swayed, leaning ever a little more forward,
till at last her head drooped, her arms stretched out,
and her lips touched that darkened patch where they
rested in a mute and desperate caress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Master,” she pleaded, “master, where are you now?
Why did you go; why are you not here where
you used to be? The evil waits still, and all is empty
and cold and dead without you, all dead, all dead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice ceased like a wail in the night, drowned
in silence. Her lips pressed close to the stain till they
seemed to infuse into it the message of her own blood,
while the blind fingers groped and groped for that they
could not find. Then with a sigh that hung tremulous
in the throbbing air she moved to the portrait, made a
slow, despairing gesture of farewell, and glided back
to the door and out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick, rooted where he stood, thrilled to a new
light that began to flicker in his brain. The fabric of
his imagination was becoming more substantial. He
had seen the soul of a woman stripped of all disguise,
and heard a voice that was robbed of all powers of
concealment. The essential meaning of this danced
before his mind’s eye.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch5'>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE PAPER-KNIFE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE VILLAGE of Bamberley lay about two miles
from Beech Lodge, a homelike nest of buildings
gathered in a wrinkle of the Sussex hills.
It was well removed from any main road, and its
thatched roofs and crooked cobbled streets had fortunately
escaped the demoralizing finger of progress. It
was, in fact, just as it had always been in the memory
of its oldest inhabitant. A village green, with the pens
of the cattle market just across the road, a rambling
public house, whose swinging sign creaked cheerily
when the wind was high, a few diminutive shops, the
contents of which were huddled in the meadows, perhaps
a hundred cottages, a dozen more pretentious
buildings dominated by the village institute—and then
the encircling hills, velvet and brown and wide, patched
with irregular coverts and dotted as far as the eye
could reach with farm-house and barn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bamberley happened to be the most important of four
adjoining villages; so here were the police headquarters
of that utterly rural district. It was a neat brick building
with the local jail immediately behind, standing
where the cross-roads provided the main interest in
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road from Beech Lodge climbs the crown of a
low hill ere it dips into the village; and Derrick, as he
strolled toward the station and looked down on all this,
thought he had never seen anything so peaceful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant, a large, ruddy-faced, cylindrical man,
greeted him with undisguised interest, and Derrick lost
no time in getting to the point. They talked in the
tiny office, which seemed filled by the other man’s bulk.
Derrick knew what he wanted, for this visit had
occasioned him much thought. He was aware, too,
that minor officials in isolated places were apt to regard
with a jealous eye anything that might infringe on
their position and privilege. It was at once obvious
that the sergeant felt an added sense of responsibility
when the visitor asked if he might read the official
documents in the Millicent case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke had been prepared by the constable for
Derrick’s coming, and during the past few weeks had
chafed at his delay. He wanted to talk about the Millicent
case more than anything else in the world. It
was the biggest and most baffling puzzle in his career,
and for a day or so the eyes of England had turned
curiously toward Bamberley. After the inquest they
turned away to the next sensation, leaving the police
force of that tiny community with the stinging sensation
of having fallen grievously short. Since then,
Burke, feeling his position more than he would ever
admit, had explored every avenue that presented itself
to his methodical mind. And always with the same
result. Now, after nearly two years of silence, the
thing was up again, brought up by a complete stranger
who had actually taken into his employ the man suspected
of the crime, against whom no definite charge
could be laid. Burke secretly wondered whether by
any chance Derrick and his gardener knew each other
a good deal better than appeared on the surface of
things. This was undoubtedly a matter for caution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The point is, sir,” he said slowly, “that I have no
authority to tell you anything whatever, unless it is
clear that the law may be aided thereby, and you have
supplementary evidence with a direct bearing on the
case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded. “I quite understand, sergeant,
and that’s entirely reasonable. Would you sooner I
looked up the counsel acting for the crown at the
inquest? I’m quite willing, if you’d rather not talk
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke reflected. He did not want to lose anything
that might help himself, nor did he want to go beyond
his boundaries. There was probably nothing
here, but he could not get the reappearance of Martin
out of his head. He had walked past the cottage
at Beech Lodge only the week before and had a look
at the man. Martin had nodded coolly and gone on
with his work. A hard man, any way one took him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please yourself, sir, about that; but if you’ll tell
me what’s in your mind perhaps it won’t be necessary
to go any further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may take a little time, sergeant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke glanced out of the window and along the
cross-roads. “We’re not likely to be disturbed this
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll begin with a question. Do you believe
in the theory that when a serious crime has been
committed, I mean one of passion or revenge, that
the criminal, wherever he may be, is constantly reminded
of it by the process of his own brain—that
in spite of all he can do he builds up picture after
picture, and lives it all over and over again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are too many proved instances of that to
doubt it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you also believe that something constantly
suggests to such a man that he should go back and
revisit the scene of the crime?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was the Hardwick case, like that,” said
Burke reminiscently. “You remember the Gloucester
Square doctor who was killed by the man who afterwards
took rooms immediately opposite the doctor’s
house; and the murderer never could tell why, except
that it seemed the only thing to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I take it that in your profession the likelihood
is really weighed and considered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, it is. Some of the London men who
came down here two years ago were talking
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another point is the matter of coincidence. How
do you feel about that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s something that has played a big part in our
work. One can’t put it aside. Coincidence and the
other things you’ve mentioned often seem to run
together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you know, of course, that Mr. Millicent’s
gardener turned up very soon after I took Beech
Lodge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Derrick; Constable Peters reported that
you had authorized him to occupy the cottage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then can you guess what brought him here all
the way from Burma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he go that far?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded. “And came back by way of
Canada—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There might be several reasons,” said the big man
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as a matter of fact there is but one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin told me himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it?” Burke’s tone had changed a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>had</span> to come. He had no bones about saying
so.” Derrick paused a moment. “Sergeant, could
an innocent man have felt like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant stared at his own massive boots,
glittering mountains of leather that shone with official
luster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything else, Mr. Derrick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you remember Perkins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly; the sort of woman one can’t forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; a strange character, showing nothing on the
surface, and so much a part of Beech Lodge that we
took her on with the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke grinned. “I can see that she hasn’t changed
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she can’t change. But did you know that
she walked in her sleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant looked at him sharply. “For a newcomer,
sir, you’ve unearthed a good deal. I never
heard that before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And would you think it of interest if I told you
that the desk at which Mr. Millicent was found is
of particular attraction to both Martin and Perkins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you say that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I’ve seen them both examining it closely
when they thought they were unobserved. They
were looking for something, sergeant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke got up, stood at the diminutive window, and
with his hands folded behind his back stared at the
verdant expanse of Bamberley Green. Obviously he
was thinking very hard. Derrick lit his pipe and
contemplated the big frame, the thick neck, and round,
neatly clipped skull. There was no promise of great
ability here, no quick perception, no imaginative brain.
Burke found his inspiration in his official regulations.
Law, order, and discipline, was it not all in a book?
He was the type for whom it was hard to let go, and
impossible to forget. And the biggest thing in his
life was still the Millicent murder. It hurt, just as
Constable Peters had intimated. Presently he turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Derrick, in most cases of crime, and especially
that of murder, the force is pestered with amateur
detectives who believe they have the one and only
clue. It’s very often a reporter for some paper.
They make all kinds of trouble, and always mix things
up if you give them any rope. But you’ve said
enough to justify me in talking about what took place
at the inquest on Mr. Millicent; though, mind you,
it’s entirely unofficial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all I ask, sergeant; and if this thing can
be solved I have no desire to appear in it at all. I’d
much sooner not. If we get any results, they’re
yours, not mine. I don’t pose as an amateur detective;
but, from what I have already seen and know, I believe
this thing can be run to earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke reached to a shelf above his head and took
down a large leather-bound volume. On the well-thumbed
pages of this were pasted envelopes, from
one of which he extracted a docket bearing the name
of Millicent, with a date. The manner in which he
turned to it suggested that this procedure had often
taken place before. He cleared his throat and began
rather stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At ten thirty on the night of October fourteenth—that’s
two years ago less three days—I was just
leaving this office when Paling, the groom of Dr.
Henry, drove up in great haste and said that I was
wanted at once at Beech Lodge by the doctor, who
was himself at that time at the Lodge. He had been
summoned there by Martin, Mr. Millicent’s gardener,
who told him that a murder had been committed.
We galloped all the way to the Lodge, arriving there
at ten thirty-seven by my watch. I left instructions
here that Constable Franklin should follow me without
delay. I was admitted by the maid Perkins, who took
me to the study, where I found Mrs. Millicent, her
daughter, and the doctor. A lamp was burning on
the desk, and beside it was Mr. Millicent, lying forward
so that his head rested on the desk. He was
quite dead. There was a large wound in his neck
that had bled profusely and formed a puddle among
his papers. The doctor very wisely had left things
undisturbed, because his first examination proved that
life was extinct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were Perkins and Martin in the room at this
time?” asked Derrick evenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, only Mrs. and Miss Millicent and the doctor.
Perkins and Martin waited in the hall with the doctor’s
groom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke turned a page. “It was, of course, most
important not to destroy the slightest clue that might
have been left, so a very careful examination of the
room was made, with exact measurement of the position
in which the body was found. I searched the
room, examined the door leading to the lawn, and
found that it was fastened. By this time Constable
Franklin had arrived, and he helped. We went over
the entire ground floor, made sure that all windows
were closed, then locked the study door, and took
Mr. Millicent up-stairs to his own room. I left the
constable on guard outside with instructions that no
person should be allowed to enter or leave the
grounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of a night was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dull, mild, and rather cloudy, with no rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the outside of the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing could be done till next morning except
make sure that any tracks should remain undisturbed;
but after a most careful examination we found nothing
of the kind. My own conclusion, and it has not been
changed since, was that the blow must have been
struck by some member of the household—or”—here
Burke paused significantly—“at any rate some one in
the family service. Mind you, Mr. Derrick, this is
absolutely unofficial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I quite understand that. Now what can you tell
me about the inquest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just coming to that. The witnesses were
narrowed to five: Mrs. Millicent and her daughter,
Dr. Henry, Perkins, and Martin. I’ll take them in
their order, so Mrs. Millicent comes first. She told a
very simple story. Her husband was forty-five, and
the latter part of their married life had been spent
at Beech Lodge. He had at one time a very comfortable
income, which latterly had been reduced by
speculations. They were not, however, in difficult
circumstances, although she seemed to know very
little of his financial affairs. He was always much
interested in anything that had to do with the Orient.
So far as she was aware he had no enemies. He spent
a good deal of his time in the garden and often went
for long walks, always alone. Since his last trip to
the East, from which he returned five years before
his death, he seemed to have some kind of worry,
of which he would never speak, or explain. Letters
had arrived for him from Singapore, at which his
worry seemed to increase; but he always destroyed
these and never referred to their contents. From
what I make of it, he was up to his eyes in something
he found it necessary to conceal from those he cared
for most. There had been no hard words with any
of the staff, and no stranger had been at the house
that day so far as we could learn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand that Mrs. Millicent engaged Perkins,
while later on her husband employed Martin. How
much later?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that any collusion between them before this
is improbable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so; and it seems that they took
very little notice of each other at any time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, as far as we have gone, the period between
the actual moment of the murder and the time
when Perkins notified Mrs. Millicent is unaccounted
for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke nodded. “Exactly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before we go on to the other evidence, can you
tell me whether anything was missed after the
murder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant opened another envelope, extracting
a sheet of brown paper some eighteen inches long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a drawing made by Mrs. Millicent of a
thing that her husband used as a paper-knife. It’s
not been found since that night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick took it eagerly and scrutinized the outline
of a murderous-looking weapon. Its curving blade
must have measured a foot, being chopped off at the
point in a curious and characteristic fashion. The
handle was heavy and carried a short guard. Its
deadly curve was unmistakable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George!” he said. “That’s a Malay creese!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Millicent got it in the East and seemed
to attach some kind of sentimental value to it. He
always kept it on his desk. Of course, it may be
that it was there for protection, though the average
man would have preferred a revolver. On the other
hand, you can see what chance any one would have
against a thing like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there are two assumptions,” answered Derrick
thoughtfully, “one that the person who committed
the crime knew that this thing was on the desk
available for his purpose; the other, that he came
without any evil intent, but a dispute developed and
in a burst of anger he picked up the creese, and
struck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’s just one person to whom both of
those cases might apply, at ten o’clock at night,” said
Burke grimly, “the person against whom we have no
evidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with that. Did anything else disappear
at the same time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So far as we know only one thing, and that apparently
not of any importance. It was a sort of
little toy image, about three or four inches high,
that Mr. Millicent used as a paper-weight. It was
carved out of a block of jade. He used to joke about
it in a queer sort of way and say it was more valuable
than they knew. Sometimes it was on his desk, but
only when he was in the room himself. At other
times he used to hide it away; but no one ever knew
where. He never talked about it, except in that joking
manner. It seems to have been an ugly-looking thing,
too, but Mrs. Millicent could not make a drawing
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden light danced in Derrick’s eyes. “Then
there was no concealment about this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more than that it used to be stowed away,
and he’d never allow it to be touched. You know
how men sometimes get queer ideas about things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s generally something quite unimportant.
Well, it was like that with this image. Matter of
fact, it was so ugly that no one in the house seemed
to want to touch it, except Perkins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said Derrick slowly. His eyes were very
keen. “Now, there are a few other questions I’d like
to ask, but first you might tell me what other evidence
was given.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant glanced out of the window. “That’s
queer! I was going to say that Miss Millicent
couldn’t tell us anything important, and there she is
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick looked up. The girl was just abreast of
the tiny office, walking slowly. Involuntarily she
turned her head, and their eyes met. Color mounted
to her cheeks, and she bowed. Derrick went out to
her quickly. There were no preliminaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May we come over in a few days? I think perhaps
you could help then.” He spoke as though their
last conversation had only been interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do!” she nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And till then I hope you’re not worrying, or
anxious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head, smiled, and sent him a look of
complete confidence. “Would it seem odd if I said
that I worry less now than in the past two years?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad of that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s quite true. I’m happier, and so is mother.
I”—she hesitated a little—“I think we don’t feel so
horribly alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not.” His voice was queerly strained.
“Indeed, you’re not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at him again, then turned quickly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick looked after her, following the slight figure
till it came to the corner of the green. Something
of him went with her, and he reëntered the sergeant’s
office wondering at himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever doubts the latter might have had about
this unofficial conference had been laid at rest.
The new master of Beech Lodge was animated by
more than mere curiosity. That was now established;
and, surveying the past two years, the big man realized
how heavily the unfathomed crime had rested on his
own spirit. The memory of it could never leave him
till the mysterious scroll was unrolled. This visit of
Derrick’s might result in nothing; but, in a way not
entirely clear, the chance of solution seemed at last
a little more probable. He looked at the young man
almost with respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I said, Miss Millicent could really tell us little
more than her mother. She seemed just as frightened
of something that might still take place as of what
had happened. She knew about the image, but
nothing of its history; and my impression was that
she linked it up with the crime in a way that none
of the rest of us did. She had no explanation of this.
I got the impression that she understood her father,
if one can put it that way, better almost than her
mother—although I have no real reason for saying
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick glanced at him shrewdly. “Nevertheless,
I’m glad you mentioned it. Anything else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir. Perkins was the next witness. She had
been in Mrs. Millicent’s employ for nearly five years.
An Englishwoman, aged thirty-eight, she had traveled
a good deal before she went into service. She stated
that on the night in question she was on her way
up-stairs from the servants’ hall—there was no other
servant there at the time—and passed the study. The
door was closed, and there was no sound; but she
could see the lamplight under the door. A little later,
when she was ready for bed, she went back to the
servants’ hall for a book and noticed that the door
was ajar and the lamp still burning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She went in, thinking that Mr. Millicent had gone
to bed and forgotten to put it out. There she found
him, bent forward over the desk, his head on one side
and a deep wound in his neck from which the blood
had poured in a pool. She said that for a moment
she could not move, then ran up-stairs, hammered at
Mrs. Millicent’s door, and told the latter that there
had been an accident in the study. Mrs. Millicent
called to her to send Martin at once for the doctor,
so she raced down to the cottage at once without
going again into the study. She found Martin, who
ran for Dr. Henry, coming back a little later with the
doctor and groom in the cart. Then the groom came
for me. As you probably know, Beech Lodge is about
half-way between Bamberley and the doctor’s house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Perkins admit having missed anything from
the desk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She mentioned the paper-knife but said nothing
about the image till she was questioned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant reflected a moment. “I didn’t make
much of what she said then. She was very upset,
and rambled a good deal, till I think the coroner was
glad to have done with her. I almost thought she
attached as much importance to that as to the paper-knife,
but of course she was hysterical.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly,” murmured Derrick. “So I take it
that Martin could not actually have seen the body
till he returned with the doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is his evidence, which I will come to in a
minute, and also Perkins statement. It would be a
matter of perhaps twenty or twenty-five minutes after
Perkins waked Mrs. Millicent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Mrs. Millicent, and I suppose her daughter,
stayed with the body till the doctor came?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where was Perkins then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Also in the study, trying to help Mrs. Millicent,
who she thought was going off her head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go back a minute. The first time Perkins
passed the study on her way up-stairs the door was
shut, and the next time ajar. How long intervened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perkins says perhaps half an hour, while she
undressed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So during that half-hour the crime was committed,
and the door was probably left ajar by the murderer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could never see it any other way, Mr. Derrick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is the time left unaccounted for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. Now you’ve reached the point where
I’ve had to leave the thing for two years, and you’ve
reached it by the same road of reasoning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick smiled. “Tell me what the doctor said,
sergeant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very little. He testified that from the condition
of the body life could not have been extinct for more
than one hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That again narrows it down to about one half-hour
in which the thing happened. The question is
what did happen, so perhaps we’d better hear what
Martin said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There again it didn’t amount to much. He stated
that he was smoking in the garden of the cottage
when Perkins came running in, half dressed, crying
out like a mad woman that Mr. Millicent had been
murdered, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She used the word ‘accident’ to Mrs. Millicent,”
interrupted Derrick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but not this time. She told Martin to get
Dr. Henry as soon as possible. There was no horse
at Beech Lodge then, so he ran all the way to
the doctor’s place. The rest of it coincided with
Perkins’s evidence. He also said that he had been
outside the cottage all the evening and could swear
that no one had entered the grounds from the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had there been any difference between him and
Mr. Millicent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Apparently not. Mr. Millicent had been in the
garden with him that afternoon, discussing the pruning
of the roses and general preparations for the
winter. Mrs. Millicent confirmed this, subsequently,
and said that her husband trusted the man implicitly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Martin mention the paper-knife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was questioned but said he knew nothing about
it. From what the others testified, it seems that he
very seldom came into the house, so it’s reasonable
he should not have known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or the image?” asked Derrick thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, nothing of that, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how long had he been in Mr. Millicent’s
employ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A matter of something less than five years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And before that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“According to his statement, knocking about in
the Orient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it is possible that he may have met
his master somewhere in the East, and the fact never
came out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hadn’t thought of that, but now it begins to
seem possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that there had for some time existed between
them something that ultimately culminated in
murder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could not get as far as that at the inquest,
sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let it stand for the present. What was Martin’s
manner or attitude while he gave evidence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bit surly, as he always is, though I think without
meaning it. It’s a bit against him that he’s apt
not to look one in the face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded. “Now I’ll only put one or two
more questions. From what you know, do you
imagine there can be any link or understanding between
him and Perkins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant shook his head with decision. “What
makes me feel there is not is that, from all I can
gather, Perkins dislikes the man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That seems to be so. When I took him on she
preferred to do the boots and coals herself, though
he was available. She’s doing them now. On the
other hand, Martin has come back around the world,
and Perkins seems riveted to the house. Neither of
them displayed any particular interest in their wages.
Martin jumped at thirty shillings a week, which is not
much as things go now. The point is, why are they
both so keen on Beech Lodge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke stroked his chin. “I suppose that’s one of
those coincidences you spoke of. I’ll admit that they
almost certainly know a good deal more than we’ve
been able to get out of them, but we haven’t got
enough evidence to hang your hat on. One can’t
make an accusation on anything else, much less an
arrest. It’s up to me to prove that so and so is
guilty, and not for him to prove that he isn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What then would you call a step toward real evidence?”
asked Derrick, with a little lift in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Proof that either Perkins or Martin had been lying
at the inquest, or”—he added with an incredulous
smile—“the discovery of that paper-knife, or even
the image.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick put his hand in his pocket and laid a small
dark green object on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it at all like this, sergeant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood rushed suddenly to the big man’s temples.
“My God, sir! where did you find that?”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch6'>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>GOD—OR DEVIL?</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE THING on the table was a diminutive image,
about three and a half inches high. It was
carved, apparently, from a single block of
the most perfect jade, and when the sergeant, fingering
it delicately, held it toward the window, the light
filtered through it, illuminating it with striking
translucency. The base was perhaps two and a half
inches square, supporting a tiny throne, on which sat
a figure clothed in flowing robes. Each individual
drape and fold was produced with absolute fidelity.
The hands of the figure were folded, showing narrow
finger-nails of extreme length; and though the general
suggestion was that of the god Buddha, Derrick remembered
that in such images as he had seen the
right hand was raised in benediction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no benediction here. The head was
bent slightly forward, the slits of Oriental eyes were
represented as half closed, and over the whole face
rested an expression of utter and fiendish malignity.
One could not imagine anything more devilish and
cruel. There was power in the face, an abysmal
knowledge that penetrated all human frailty and disguise,
and a certain fixed, implacable purpose. Derrick
had spent hours in secret scrutiny of the thing,
and it seemed to him that here was the presentment
of the embodiment of evil, and, fixed with an infinity
of patient art, there had been transmitted to this
opaque and precious stone the picture of some soul,
wicked and irretrievably damned. Even now as he
stared a chill ran through his body, and he glanced
at the sergeant to determine whether he, too, were not
susceptible to this malign emanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that I ever saw a more ugly thing
in my life,” said the latter slowly. “Where did you
find it, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not much use at the moment to try and tell
you what led up to that. I can only say that ever
since going into the house I have been conscious of
something. I had no reason to believe that anything
of this kind existed there, and in spite of what you
have said I can’t quite see that this is really evidence,
as yet. All we know is that it used to stand on
Millicent’s desk and was missed after the murder. It
may be the thing that both Martin and Perkins were
seeking, but it was removed during that half-hour of
which we spoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My first move would be to confront them both
with this thing when they didn’t expect it, and watch
what happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I can’t agree with you there. I’ve
never studied your profession but fancy you’d get
as much out of them as out of the image itself. Perkins
has been under very close observation for weeks
without knowing it, and her face is a mask. Martin
is much the same. The minds of both of them are
foreign countries, so far as we are concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant leaned forward. There was no doubt
about his attitude now. “Perhaps you’re right, sir,
but what is in your mind as to the next move?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t gone far enough to say, and there’s an
old proverb about hurrying slowly. Meantime I’d
like to know whether you agree that to-day there are
aspects of the case that so far have not been considered
at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fairness to you, sir, I must admit that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll also agree that of the two ways of
approaching it the inductive method is the only one
to be considered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke was genuinely puzzled and showed it. “I’m
afraid I don’t quite follow you there, Mr. Derrick.
It sounds like one of those magazine stories where
the police always fall down and the amateur pulls the
thing off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick laughed. “I’ve an idea the police won’t
fall down this time if they adopt the right method—at
least the method that I would follow myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant looked at him curiously. “And how
would you start in this case, may I ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not knowing who the murderer is, let us assume
one and proceed on that assumption. We can safely
say that he did his work between nine and ten at
night. We assume also that he did not come with
any murderous intent, unless, and this is a point that
must be carefully considered, unless he knew that
there was on Mr. Millicent’s desk a weapon suitable
for his purpose. We also assume that he knew about
the image, though for some reason he denied this,
and, more than that, believed that it had something
to do with some act that weighed against him—say, in
the Orient. Mr. Millicent also knew this, and therefore
concealed it, and thereby maintained his hold over
the criminal—or the man who finally became the
criminal. That the image should have remained undisturbed
for two years points to the absence of the
criminal for that period.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick paused for a moment and looked hard at
the sergeant. “Are you with me thus far?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, go on, sir,” was the tense answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, add to that the characteristics of Perkins
and Martin, and there remains the doubt as to whether
the woman actually did run to Mrs. Millicent’s room
the minute she made the discovery. Admit the possibility
that she actually saw the murder committed,
and, having secret reasons for sparing Martin, allowed
him to return to the cottage before giving the alarm.
Assume, for instance, that she was terrified by Martin
into doing this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant struck his clenched fist into his palm.
“By God, sir! but that’s more than likely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing in the evidence to prevent it
being the case except the testimony of two persons
who you believe know more than was drawn out. It
simply involves the reversal of the sequence of two
actions to both of which Perkins was sworn. To-day
she is to all appearances a broken-hearted woman.
Why? Two reasons; one that the master to whom
she was so undoubtedly devoted was killed; the other
that for fear of her own life she has committed herself
to the protection of the criminal. In this connection
there’s a very interesting point. When Martin
came to me and asked for a job, I made a point of
privately inquiring from Perkins whether, from all
she knew of him, and under all the circumstances,
I would do well to take him on. Her answer was that
if I wanted a garden like Mr. Millicent’s I should take
him. It seems to me now that she was afraid of what
would happen if she said anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, that fits in perfectly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick got up and relit his pipe. “Then, I think
we might let the matter rest there for a while, and I
won’t trouble you any further this morning. If it
is decided to do anything later on, it will all be done
through you, as I do not wish to appear in the thing
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good, sir, and if I can help, which I’d like
to, I’ll go as far as my duties permit, and maybe”—here
the sergeant grinned meaningly—“a bit further.”
He pointed to the jade god. “Had I better keep this
thing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick shook his head, picked up the image
gingerly, and slipped it in his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks, I want to use it for a while. By
the way, do you know whether I can get a couple of
pounds of green wax in Bamberley?”</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>Jean Millicent’s unpremeditated visit to Beech Lodge
had marked a turning-point in the long, gray months
that followed her father’s death. The violence and
brutality of this had shocked her beyond words, while
to her sense of loss was added the numbing knowledge
that on the very threshold of life she had been confronted
with the worst that life had to exhibit.
Millicent himself had had no surviving relations; her
mother’s people, after the first horrified sympathy,
did not allow the matter to burden them further; and,
as the girl impulsively told Derrick, she felt tremendously
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between mother and daughter there was complete
love—and a limited understanding. The real link had
been with Millicent, from whom Jean inherited the
subjective side of her nature. She had a profound
belief in mysterious influences, incapable of analysis,
but controlling nevertheless the world of unseen things.
She realized that she moved among these, swaying
unconsciously to their faint pressure, the recipient
of distant and unmistakable signals that flicked over
the horizon of existence. She had never talked much
about this with her father. His own belief had of
late been too burdened with an apprehension she never
fathomed. But she understood where her mother
often failed to understand, silently completing the
sentences he sometimes left unfinished, putting her
mind parallel with his, and building up a queer unexplainable
union that expressed itself not so much
in speech as in those fleeting glances of comprehension
that are more eloquent than any words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something of this she recognized in Derrick, and
the psychology of the moment was such that it meant
more than she could well express. While she was
with her mother, her heart needed no other companion,
though her spirit was lonely. But she had not been
lonely during her visit to Beech Lodge, however
strange the circumstances. She knew now that the
visit was intended. For the first time she had been
in touch with another intelligence that acknowledged
what she acknowledged but remained poised and unafraid.
It was like traveling through an unknown
and threatening country, and meeting one to whom all
its roads are familiar and who traverses them without
fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after Derrick’s visit to the sergeant,
he and his sister walked two lovely miles to the
Millicents’. Edith was glad of it for several reasons.
She admitted being lonely, and also welcomed anything
that lifted her brother out of himself. For the
past few weeks she had watched him closely, saying
nothing. He was less distrait and more like his old
self, but she knew that the novel progressed not at
all. He was busy in his own peculiar way, and she
asked no questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was charmed with Mrs. Millicent, found they
had much in common, and noted with contentment
that Jean and her brother seemed like old friends.
While all four were together, the subject of Beech
Lodge was instinctively avoided, but a little later
Derrick found himself in the cottage garden with Jean.
It was after a pause that she sent him a straight
questioning look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m waiting. Something tells me you’ve
been very busy and, I think, successful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Busy, yes,” he smiled, “but I don’t know how
successful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you have a long talk at the police station?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fairly long. The sergeant regarded me at first
as most officials regard the amateur, but he was
interested before I left. It seems that he regards
your father’s case as the one unsatisfactory spot
on his record. It’s odd to talk to a man who is so
blunt and at the same time has to admit that he’s
beaten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you haven’t told me yet. I know by your
face there’s something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he admitted, “there is. Will you let me
know what you can about a small image that came
from Burma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The jade god?” she said swiftly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—or devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How extraordinary! Have you come to that,
too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or else it came to me. Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrank involuntarily, then, without touching
the thing he had taken from his pocket, stared at it
closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are there two? Where did you find that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he smiled, “this is a cast in green wax made
from a mold I took of the image itself. I—” he
hesitated—“I did not like to carry the original about
with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are very wise, but where did you find
the original?” Her eyes were full of wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It happened a week ago, the day before I went
to see Sergeant Burke. I was in the study, looking
at your father’s portrait as I often do, when it seemed
more than ever that he was trying to tell me something.
That has often been the case before, but never
as vividly. He wanted to speak, and I believe he was
speaking, but not in a language I could understand.
Then I got up and stood in front of him and could
have sworn the expression of his eyes changed. They
appeared to be looking down at something below himself
and not far away. Without knowing it I put
out my hand as though to meet an invisible one held
out to me, and touched the oak frame on the side of
the mantel. You know those old carvings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was just under the upper one. Then I heard
a click, and a small panel fell forward, opening a tiny
cupboard about six inches square. The original of
this thing was inside, as though it had been waiting
for me. I did not touch it at once but looked up,
and there was a sort of relief in the painted eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on; please go on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t much more to say, as yet, except that
to my knowledge both Perkins and Martin have
searched the study for something I take to be the
original of this. There’s one other thing to be found
now. Evidence was given that it was there that
evening and has not been seen since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what that is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I have an idea it’s not far away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you say that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, but I feel it. Meantime will you
tell me what you know of the image?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father brought it back from Burma about seven
years ago,” she said slowly, “and seemed both to
love and fear it. I have always thought it terrible,
as though half the evil in the world had been captured
in that bit of green stone. From the time he brought
it back he himself appeared to change. I felt that
the more because we were very near each other, he
and I, and he believed what you believe. We never
talked much about it, as that didn’t seem necessary.
As to the image, I knew it was somewhere in the study
but didn’t know where. No one did. All he ever
said about it was that he got it up country. I have
seen Perkins come in when it was on the desk, try not
to look at it, then stare as though fascinated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Martin ever see it?” put in Derrick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and it had the same effect on him. I often
wanted to smile at grown people feeling like that,
but somehow I couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, if either Perkins or Martin wanted it there
would have been no great difficulty in stealing it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not, but I had a queer idea that though
their fingers itched for it they were afraid to touch it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet it kept Perkins at Beech Lodge, and brought
Martin back half round the world. It sent out vibrations
to which they had to respond.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You believe that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all fits in,” she admitted slowly. “Always in
the study I’ve felt some kind of war going on between
influences; good fighting with evil. Father used to
feel that, too. The room found its own voice and
spoke, and against that was the voice of the jade god,
confusing and confounding everything with threatening
messages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you are satisfied there was no common
interest between Perkins and Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how that could be. She never had
anything to do with him and didn’t even like having
him about the house. I never saw them together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ask if you know what your father actually
did in Burma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sometimes he talked about the Mong Hills,
but he never made any money in the Orient and used
to come back saying that he had been in touch with
strange things and people. That used to content him,
but latterly he sometimes used to look desperate. As
to money, we have always had enough to live quietly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think he had any premonitions of death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m sure of that. Once he said that it was
harder to live than die, so he expected to live a long
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that after his last trip?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick was silent for a moment. “Does Mrs. Millicent
know that I’m working on this?” he asked
presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sent him a quick smile. “Yes, and she thinks
it’s tremendously kind of you but that it can’t come to
anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sister knows, too, and can’t see the point,
either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She would feel that it is interfering with your work.
I feel it, too, and it may prevent a splendid book from
being written. Am I tremendously selfish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her steadily, and her eyes met his without
flinching. She stood, tall, slim, and straight, with
a proud carriage to her head and a broad serenity of
brow. Imagination was in her face, the beauty of
whose contour filled him with a sort of comforting
satisfaction. It was firm but gentle, courageous but
sweet. Her eyes were a little wistful, and charged
with changing lights and shadows that he found infinitely
appealing. She awakened both heart and spirit,
and he knew she could awaken his soul. What would
it be like to be cared for by such a girl? He felt that
already there existed between them something more
than friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you forgive me for putting you through such
an inquisition?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing to forgive, and everything to
thank you for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are very brave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brave! It is you who are brave. We have no
claim, no reason why you should be involved in all
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” he said thoughtfully, “I was involved
before we two ever met.” He made a sudden impulsive
gesture, but it was his eyes that spoke next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled gravely, and at that smile he knew that
another voice had reached him from the unknown.
It carried no mysterious threat; it was unburdened
with tragedy; it emanated neither from wood nor stone
nor a jade devil. It was part of the rest, but all grace
and purity and joy; a whisper of life, not death. What
sped between them then he could never tell, but some
echo of that whisper must have reached Jean, for her
glance, strange and lingering and perhaps prophetic,
met his own for a memorable instant while the color
climbed delicately to her smooth cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” she said softly, “unless I can think of
myself as having shaken all this off, and laid the ghost
of uncertainty and, yes, fear, I can never have any real
future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pressed her slim fingers. “Don’t worry about
the future,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith was very cheerful on the way home. She had
had a long talk with Mrs. Millicent, promised her Derrick’s
last book, found they had mutual friends, and in
general enjoyed herself. It was a relief to be with
some one professedly practical. Also she was beginning
to entertain a shrewd suspicion that her brother
was rather more than interested in Jean and turned the
conversation in that direction before long. She chatted
away, swinging her stick and feeling more at peace
with herself than for some time past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think they’ll stay there very long,” she hazarded.
“It’s too lonely. Mrs. Millicent spoke of
France for the summer and feels that Jean should have
a change. It’s no place for a girl like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Derrick uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From what I gathered she blames herself for having
stayed there at all. It seems she wanted to move
away altogether, but Jean wouldn’t have it. She’s
worried about the child and says that she cannot shake
the dreadful thing off, which isn’t a healthy state of
affairs at that age. You two hit it off very well, Jack,
from what I saw. You had a regular conference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “Did we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you? You ought to know. I never
realized fully before what a variety of interests you
seem to demand. First you come into the country to
write a novel—and, by the way, you’ll notice I’ve said
nothing about the novel recently—then you switch off
to a murder case, and I haven’t mentioned that either
recently, and the latest development is a perfectly new
young woman of undoubted charm, of whom I begin
to have suspicions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And of whom perhaps you won’t say anything at
all,” he parried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith nodded. “Nothing could arouse feminine intuition
more than that remark. However, she’s
awfully attractive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick grinned. “Suppose we leave it at that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, brother, but just in case my feminine intuition
happens to be right, I wouldn’t take Miss Millicent
too seriously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very oracular to-day, Edith. What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her mother practically said that she didn’t understand
that girl, but did know that she still felt very
strangely about her father’s death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One can imagine that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course, but it works in a curious way on her
mind. She imagines herself linked with it in some odd
fashion and won’t think of marrying till the thing is
cleared up, which, of course, it never will be now. She
argues that she has her father’s blood and all that, and
she may have inherited some kind of threat or danger
or whatever it was that killed him. The very idea
seems grotesque to me, but there you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else did Mrs. Millicent say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very little more about Jean, and nothing of her
husband, but she did talk about Perkins and Martin.
I suppose she wanted to reassure me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything new about them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing much. Perkins seems to have been just
as invaluable to them as she is to me. You know,
Jack, I’ve rather changed my mind about that woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what way? Perkins hasn’t changed that I can
see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a fraction. She looks just as forbidding and
severe and wet-blankety as ever, and that used to worry
me more than you ever knew. Also I was puzzled
about you, and the influence the place seemed to be
getting over you, upsetting your work. I’ve got over
that now, and Perkins has turned out a regular trump.
I’m beginning to see what’s behind that manner of
hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, it’s only that of a broken-hearted woman, her
way of expressing it, and nothing else. Yet in spite of
that she’s a household treasure. Things do themselves;
there’s no lost energy and no lost time. If
Perkins could be duplicated in sufficient quantities
she’d revolutionize domestic life in England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a pity she’s never married and started a new
breed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith decapitated a surviving thistle. “That kind
doesn’t marry very often. They’re born into the
world without any desire for marriage, and perhaps it’s
just as well in this case. She’d be working for her
husband and not for us. Marriage,” she added quizzically,
“isn’t the solution for everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why do you say she’s broken-hearted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because of a queer thing that happened last night.
I wasn’t going to say anything about it, but you’re
so unusually sensible to-day that it doesn’t matter. I
was lying half awake last night, and seemed to hear
some one talking at a little distance with no attempt
at concealment, and quite loud, so I wasn’t nervous.
It was a woman’s voice. I got up and prowled about
and found it came from Perkins’s room. She was talking
in her sleep in a queer, flat tone, talking very fast,
apparently arguing with some one, greatly excited and
rather desperate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was she saying?” put in Derrick sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the strange part of it; I couldn’t understand
a word. It was all in some strange liquid sort
of language, ending in ‘ong’ and ‘yang’ and ‘ing,’ and
sounds like that. Three or four times she said, ‘Master,
master.’ That must have meant Mr. Millicent, to
whom she was so devoted. All of a sudden it stopped,
as though her brain had come back from its travels,
and I heard nothing more. This morning I looked at
her very closely, but not a line of her face had changed,
and her eyes were just the same as ever. She had evidently
been dreaming about Mr. Millicent’s death, and,
Jack, that’s the biggest thing in her life now. She
was dour and silent before; Mrs. Millicent said so
to-day; and one can imagine what a tragedy like that
must mean to a queer locked-up nature like hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you remember any of the foreign words she
used?” he asked casually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She frowned a little, thinking hard. “There were
two that came quite often, more than any others, one
something like ‘rumah,’ ‘sambayüng,’ and the other like
‘santari.’ That’s as near as I can get to it. Why do
you ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No particular reason, except that I’d like to identify
the language.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not going to speak to Perkins herself, are
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he smiled. “Far be it from me to put my
finger into the wheels of domestic comfort. Anything
more about her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing except that I’m going to try and cheer
her up, and coax out a smile or two. As it is she
smiles about once a week. Then there’s Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite know. I’ve been watching him at
work and talking to him occasionally, and what strikes
me is that here at Beech Lodge are two of the loneliest
souls imaginable. I’ve got it now!” she added suddenly.
“Why shouldn’t they marry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Derrick, startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, just think a minute. It might work splendidly
for all concerned,” continued Edith, warming to
the idea. “Martin, in spite of his appearance, is as
faithful as a dog, and he absolutely loves flowers.
This place is going to be a picture next summer. He’s
had some sort of a blow, too, and his eyes are often
more sad than I can describe, and not a bit shifty or
furtive. And he’s beginning to like you just as he
used to like Mr. Millicent from all accounts. Jack,
why shouldn’t they marry? Don’t you suppose it’s
possible that that’s what brought him back, looking
for Perkins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick did not answer at once. The idea was too
fantastic. It was not Perkins that Martin sought when
he returned, nor was she the type of woman to bring
a suspected man round the world to a place which for
every reason he should avoid. They shared something;
he was sure of that; but whatever it was it had
dug a gulf between them, and to discover a bridge to
span that gulf was Derrick’s aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were you I’d put that idea out of my head,”
he said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith was a little disappointed. “Why? Stranger
things have happened before this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the tip of his tongue to say that stranger
things would probably happen, but he only laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know nothing of their past—that is, before they
came to Beech Lodge—and their future is their own.
It’s too delicate a business. Perkins doesn’t like
Martin, though she was bound to recommend him as
an excellent gardener, and it would be stretching the
point a good deal to imagine that she is anything to
him. She hardly speaks to him as it is. Didn’t you
say just now that she was not the marrying kind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I did; but since there’s no probability of my
arranging my own wedding, I rather like to potter
about with other people’s. That may be useful to you,
Jack, later on. As to Perkins, I dare say you’re right,
and after all, if they did ultimately come together, it
couldn’t be utterly festive, could it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he laughed, “it couldn’t. What else is there
in the mind of the thoughtful Martha?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing except that I’d like to make those two
lives a bit more cheery, if I could; and naturally one’s
mind pitches ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does,” he admitted. “Do you feel prophetic at
the moment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sent him a keen glance, at which he colored in
spite of himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe, old boy, you’re quite ready for me
to go on yet.”</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>Now, if one takes the case of a highly sensitive and
imaginative young man, whose mind is continually exploring
for new sensations, and plunges him into a situation
that is clothed with grimness and mystery, there
will inevitably be set up a series of reactions such as
Derrick had been experiencing for weeks past. And
if, further, he then comes into touch with the girl whom
he desires for his own, discovers her to be involved in
the mystery, and realizes that she will remain out of
reach till the problem is solved and her spirit set free,
there will be added to his efforts the greatest incentive
of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was with Derrick. Both from Jean herself
and from Jean’s mother he now knew exactly where
he stood. Though not told in so many words, he was
under no misapprehension. All thought of his own
work disappeared. This was his work, and the call of
it was irresistible. As for Edith, and he smiled when
he thought of her, she was in no danger. She stood
too far outside the sweep of the drama, and it would be
an error in tactics to tell her too much. He believed
he would need her help at the end, but the end was not
yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was returning from a long and solitary walk
when, nearing Beech Lodge, he noted on the road ahead
a curious figure. It was that of an elderly-looking
man who tramped some hundred yards in advance.
His clothing was loose and weather-beaten. He
stooped a little forward as he walked, and supported
himself on a staff which he had evidently cut by the
way. As Derrick drew abreast he took a sidelong
glance and at once remarked the brightness of the
stranger’s eyes. Physically he did not seem more than
fifty years old. A first impression of age was given
by the whiteness of his beard, but in spite of both
stoop and stick he moved with an agility that belied
his apparent years. His skin was a dark olive shade,
his nose hooked like a raven’s beak, and his cotton
shirt was open at the neck, showing where a thin gold
chain lay yellow against the swarthy flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick, meeting a swift look, experienced a sudden
thrill. What manner of man was this to find in a
Sussex lane? It seemed that something invisible but
enormously potent moved down the road beside him.
Then, instinctively, he halted at the gate of Beech
Lodge and waited till the stranger came up. The latter
made a sweeping gesture of salutation, and swung forward
the pack that had been balanced on his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, sir. Will you buy a trinket and
help an old man on his way? Cheap, sir, cheap, so
cheap that they’re nothing short of presents, trade is
that bad. Worse than I ever saw it in this country
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke in a thin singsong voice that carried with it
a sort of outlandish lilt. No British peddler this, but
one from foreign parts. Derrick felt a now familiar
thrill, and the spirit of him scented the Orient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What part of the world do you hail from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any and every part, sir. So long as it’s south of
the line it makes no difference to me. Central America,
Bengal, Borneo, the Cape, Cochîn, and Singapore,
they’re all the same.” He shivered a little. “Time
was when I thought the old country was the only place
in the world, but I’ve got over that now, specially in
winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been here long this time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A matter of a few months, but I’m going back
East. This wind is too much for my bones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you got?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pack was unrolled deftly on the wet grass, and
inside lay a long strip of raw silk. Opening this after
a swift glance down the road, the stranger revealed a
medley of things, some beautiful, many valuable, and
none of them ordinary. No Manchester stock was
this. He had chains of native workmanship, hammered
bangles of gold and silver, semi-precious stones
carved with amazing cleverness, bits of oddly shaped
ivory, all the paraphernalia of the peddler of the Far
East. These he showed with obvious and lingering interest
as though he loved them, pattering meantime of
the Sunda Islands, the Moluccas, Bali, Lombok, and a
host of Eastern ports and places whose accustomed
names fell from his lips with glib fluency. There was
no doubt about his knowing the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This, sir, is a bit of hammered tin from Kuantan
in Pahang, and you don’t get much of that kind of
work nowadays. They wash the tin out of the gravel
on the hillsides, and there are only three men in Malaysia
who turn out this grade of art. This gold bangle
is from Berak—all Chinese labor there—and you can
have it for ten shillings. Better take it, sir, for it
weighs twenty pennyweight and is worth a sovereign
for the gold alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why not sell it as gold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t offer it unless I were footsore and had
to have somewhere to sleep. Can’t sell this sort of
thing in an English village. I’d get arrested for having
it; that’s why I’m heading for London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His piercing eyes rested on Derrick while he spoke,
and in them moved something more than a mere interested
scrutiny. Then they roamed curiously about
the neighborhood. A brain was working behind those
eyes, and it occurred to Derrick that this man knew
well where he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever been in this part of England before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lean brown fingers hung motionless over the
trinkets. “No, sir, there’s nothing to bring my kind
here unless it’s the June race meet. Won’t you take
this bangle? There’s a good twenty pennyweight of
fine gold in it. There isn’t a lady who would turn up
her nose at it. I’ve seen a woman bought and sold
for one not half as good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick hesitated. Strange thoughts were coursing
through his head and with them the growing conviction
that this, like all the rest of it, was meant to be. Perhaps
it was grotesque, but had not Perkins said weeks
ago that others were coming to Beech Lodge, drawn
by mysterious signals they could not withstand? Then
Martin had come, and Jean Millicent, and who should
say that here was not the last of the gathered company.
It was not a bundle of trinkets that had brought this
wanderer to these tragic gates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your name? You speak good English,
but you’re not English, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peddler shook his head. “No, sir, my name is
Blunt. My father was English and my mother a
Malay woman. I was born out there and spent most
of my time between the islands. Now I’m for getting
back as soon as I can, so I’m heading for the East
India Docks, where I’ll sign on. It’s too cold for me
in this country. Couldn’t I spend the night in one of
the outhouses, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Derrick thoughtfully, “I think perhaps
my gardener might find a corner for you in his cottage.
I’ve no objections. You can see him about it, if you
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s dark eyes took on a sudden gleam.
“That’s good of you, sir, and I won’t be a bit of
trouble to any one. If there’s any work to be done,
I’ll do it. Here, you’d better take this bangle now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held out the yellow circlet. Derrick was about
to refuse when something whispered to him to take it.
Slipping it into his pocket, he was surprised at its
weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you offer something worth a sovereign for
a night’s lodging?” he queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peddler sent him a curious glance. “That’s all
right, sir. A few pennyweight of gold is neither here
nor there in a lifetime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded. “Perhaps not—to either of us. If
you turn in here I think you’ll find the gardener just
on the other side of the cottage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man rolled up his pack and moved along the
drive toward the house. Derrick stood irresolute for
a moment; then something impelled him to follow.
Presently he stopped and, making no noise, slipped behind
a sheltering tree. The peddler was now thirty
yards ahead. At this moment Martin, who had been
working among his rose-bushes, looked up and saw the
stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What happened next was all over in an instant. He
made a swift involuntary gesture in which fear and
astonishment were tensely blended. The spade slipped
from his fingers, and his eyes protruded. He seemed
to sway a little as he stood with an uncouth elephantine
motion, and his lips trembled, but no sound came from
them. Then, as Derrick emerged from behind the tree
and came carelessly toward him, he made an extraordinary
noise in his throat and turned again to his work.
And, so far as the master of Beech Lodge could determine,
the peddler had given no sign whatever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick lounged forward with a manner of complete
indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin, this man has asked that he might sleep
somewhere on the place to-night, and I told him I had
no objection to his spending it in the cottage if you’re
willing. His name is Blunt, and it’s for you to say.
You will be responsible for him if he does stay, so you
can settle it between you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gardener’s face had become rigidly impassive,
but there was no concealing the blood that surged into
it. He glanced first at his master, then at the mysterious
stranger, and moistened his dry lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Name of Blunt, sir,” he said thickly. “That will
be all right as far as I’m concerned. I’ll look after
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick, fearing that his curiosity might become too
apparent, nodded and strolled on toward the house.
He was very deep in thought. Another factor was now
added to the problem and had to be dealt with. In a
way it was not unexpected. There had been built up
a triangle with a dead man in the center and an undeciphered
personality at each corner. Was this all coincidence,
or was not destiny rather arranging the puppets
of a great drama without any extraneous assistance?</p>

<p class='pindent'>His first instinct was to report the new arrival to
Sergeant Burke, but on second thought he decided to
say nothing at the moment. The sergeant’s methods
were too heavy-handed, too likely to disturb whatever
process was now at work. However vague to human
eyes it might be, he was convinced that subtle causes
were in motion, wheels of fate that revolved within
other wheels, a mechanism that operated silently,
mysteriously, and with some inflexible purpose. As to
himself, he could only wait. Instructions would come,
as they always had come, and in the appointed time,
from the same imperceptible and unchanging source.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As though in search of these, he went into the study
and gave himself up to thought, leaving the windows
of his mind open to the lightest breath of influence.
His vision embraced four divergent figures, all of them
inextricably linked. Perkins, with the half-told tale
of her life shrouded behind her sphinx-like face, a
domestic automaton as imperturbable as the jade god
itself, the rigid guardian of her own secret, who talked
a strange language in her sleep, and in that sleep
mourned the disappearance of her murdered master.
Martin, new come from round the world, the recipient
of viewless signals that reached and followed him
through the rotting jungles, signals that worked and
whispered till they penetrated his slow brain and he
came back perforce ten thousand miles of land and
sea, a suspect to the source of suspicion, to work
within sight of the window of the dead man of whose
violent passing he no doubt knew the secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the peddler, with restless intelligence in his ageless
eyes, himself a traveler from the same land of
strange peoples, tongues, and gods, tramping indomitably
along the deep Sussex lanes till he arrived as
though by chance at the door of one who apparently
knew him not, yet regarded his advent with fear and
astonishment. And, last of all, Jean Millicent, the
shadow of tragedy clouding her bright youth, a creature
made for love and tenderness and care but weighted
with brooding apprehensions, toward whom his own
spirit had begun to move, striving, seeking, and hoping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compassed with thoughts like these, he saw himself
in relation to those profound forces which, whether
acknowledged or not, dominate our lives. The winds
of circumstance seemed to him no longer the winds of
chance. There was purpose behind all, some high and
remote goal to which we are led along roads that might
seem strange and byways that wander apparently from
the general direction. He knew now that it would be
futile to attempt anything save the task that lay directly
ahead, and till that task was discharged Jean Millicent
could never be his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was still plunged in reflection when Edith’s entrance
brought him sharply back to earth. She came
into the study, noted that he was not working, seemed
about to speak, then smiled at him inquiringly. He
smiled back. She took a penny from her pocket and
laid it silently on the desk. Derrick was feeling for
another when his fingers closed round the gold bangle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you wear this?” he asked casually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She examined it with delighted and intense interest.
“It’s perfectly lovely, Jack; but where on earth did you
get it? Not in Bamberley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much,” he laughed. “I got it as a present a
few minutes ago from my paying guest, or rather
Martin’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a peddler down at the cottage now. He
has a pack full of things like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “Jack, you know you can’t
afford it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right and didn’t cost me anything. It’s
the price of a night’s lodging with Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why didn’t the man give it to Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That never occurred to me. He was tired and
footsore, wanted shelter for the night, and I suggested
to Martin that he take him in and be responsible for
him. The man insisted that I take this, so there you
are. Cheap at the price, I call it. There’s a sovereign
worth of gold in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith pushed the bangle on her wrist and twisted it
thoughtfully. “Why don’t you tell me the real truth,
old boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have. Want to see him? Interesting sort of person,
white beard, bright eyes, and been everywhere.
You’ll never guess where he’s come from now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Burma,” said Derrick meaningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that where you told me Martin had come from
when he turned up here?” she asked slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was silent for a moment. “Well, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at her thoughtfully. “It’s all part of the
rest of it. I’m caught up in something stronger than
myself. I can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took off the bangle and laid it on the desk. “Do
you know where it’s leading you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded, smiling. “Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Jean Millicent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that,” he said gravely. “It seems now that
it was meant I should find her like this. It was all
meant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith nodded. “When I saw you two together the
other day I felt the same thing, so you’d better give her
this. It’s more appropriate. You see, Jack,” she
went on with a smile that was rather sober, “I’m not
the marrying kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense,” he expostulated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s quite true, and girls know it by instinct rather
early in life. Then they try to forget it, and settle
down in a sort of way to making other people comfortable.
But they can’t help seeing what’s going on all
round them—I mean other girls with their men—and
feeling a bit out of it. It’s a bit solemn for a woman
to realize that she’ll never waken the biggest thing in
the world in the heart of a man, because she lacks the
indescribable something that is necessary, and it makes
a good many of us queer and cantankerous. You see
we don’t possess what every woman longs for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes, too, she has a sort of perception about
others. I had it when I saw you with Jean; and, Jack,
it made me happier than in a long time. That’s why
I want you to give her this bangle, which is really
lovely, and also tell me just what I can do to help. You
needn’t make any bones about that. It’s my job, and
I’m thankful for it. And for goodness’ sake, old boy,
don’t think of me as being down in the mouth. I’m
not. I understand about you and Jean, and nothing
would make me happier, but as for all the rest of this
queer affair I don’t understand it at all. So tell me
what I can do, and I’ll do it. And don’t you ever think
of me as a good-hearted and deserving spinster, or I’ll
never forgive you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a long speech for Edith, who but seldom let
herself go. Derrick was oddly touched and patted her
arm affectionately. He knew she wanted no thanks and
felt that in the next few days he might need her more
than ever before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to tell you something. You probably won’t
accept it as I do, but you ought to know, and somehow
I’m glad you don’t believe in the occult.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t,” she said frankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he laughed, “please carry on. Nothing
could help me more. I’ve no desire to spend the rest
of my life in criminal investigation. I know you
think I’m being carried too far by this one and am
collecting a lot of unimportant data that I anticipate
will produce something remarkable later on. Perhaps
I am, but I’m going to see it through, and you know
what I’m working for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a darling,” murmured Edith, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means everything to have you say that.” He
looked at her keenly and, deliberating how much to tell
her of what was in his mind, decided to leave the matter
where it stood and disclose only what was necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll think it wild of me to associate the coming
of this peddler with Millicent’s murder, but I do. I
want to keep him here a few days if I can. There’s
something, I don’t know what, in the air; but the
thing that brought him is probably what brought
Martin. I’ll talk with him later on. Would you like
to go up to town for a few days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” she asked, puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been thinking it’s rather unfeeling of me to
expect you to be here at present under the circumstances.
A good many women would not like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith smiled and shook her head. “My dear, I
can’t take it as seriously as you do, and I’m not nervous.
Do anything you like that you believe will
bring you nearer Jean. Be as mysterious and occult
as you please. It won’t worry me a bit. But the
house must be looked after, and that’s for me. I
hope this won’t upset Perkins, as things are going very
smoothly in her domain, and don’t forget that it will
imperil next year’s roses if you demoralize Martin.
Now it’s time for lunch.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch7'>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A MYSTERIOUS PEDDLER</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>E WENT to the Millicents’ that afternoon, the
bangle in his pocket, and found Jean unaffectedly
glad to see him. Mrs. Millicent had
said nothing to her daughter, but her manner had been
that of one who approves. She liked Derrick and had
conceived a genuine fondness for Edith. The contemplated
summer in France was becoming a little indefinite.
In a few moments she murmured something
and disappeared. Derrick thought rapidly and looked
straight into the girl’s clear eyes. Then he held out
the bangle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you take this from me? It has a curious
something about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean hesitated, the look on his face being unmistakable.
“It’s charming. Where did you get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Burma,” he said slowly. “It arrived this
morning by a peddler who is staying the night with
Martin. He seemed grateful for my allowing it and
insisted that I take this from his pack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at the yellow circlet. “Does he know
Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He pretended that he did not, but Martin knew
him without question and was horrified to see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean did not speak, but her eyes were full of swift
wonder. “And then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it was my turn to pretend that I had noticed
nothing. They are together now and will be till to-morrow
morning, at any rate. That’s one reason I
came here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not ask the other but slid the bangle on her
wrist with a slow and lingering touch. Derrick’s gaze
did not leave her. He saw the color flood and desert
her cheek, and the pulse throbbing in her slim throat.
How utterly desirable she was! This was the indescribable
quality about which Edith had talked with
a cheerfulness that he now saw must have cost her
dearly; the thing that secured what all women at some
time long to possess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited breathlessly, but she was still silent. Her
heart whispered one thing, but over her there yet hung
a cloud of memories that well nigh blotted out all else.
For so long she had thought of herself as the child of a
foully murdered man, for so long had the menace
seemed to be transferred to herself, that the promise
of a future such as she believed she saw in Derrick’s
eyes seemed almost as unreal as it was divine. She
was already more than fond of him and admitted it in
secret hours. It was something new and strange and
alluring for the mind to feed on. But what escape
would it mean till the secret of Beech Lodge had been
read, and the weight lifted from her soul? She took
the bangle because she did not want to hurt him, but
her eyes avoided his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think is going to happen now?” she
asked shakily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I wanted to see you first of all. Do
you remember such a man ever coming to Beech Lodge
before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is he like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told her, and she shook her head. “I can’t think
of any one. Martin had no friends even in the village,
and father had no visitors from the East. Can it be
the image that brought him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing else, as I see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could he know it was there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick smiled. “How did I know? It’s all part
of the main puzzle, and perhaps the missing part. I
hoped you might be able to tell me something that would
throw some light on this man’s arrival. I have a queer
idea that it closes the circle, and am going to get him
into the study on some pretext.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to begin with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you told the police about him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not ready for the police yet. The first thing to
find out is whether the study means anything to him.
That little god, or devil, is there, safely out of sight
and touch, but if the peddler is what I take him to be,
he will know it, and if he has come here for it, some
attempt will be made before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what about you?” she asked nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not interested in me, but I expect he has something
to say to Martin. He’s probably saying it now.
Oh, my dear!” he went on unconsciously, “don’t you
see that we’re getting nearer to the end of it every
hour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing he might have said could have touched her
more, or given her a swifter assurance of what lay next
his heart. It moved her to see that he did not know
he had said it. So tender was the thought that she hid
it away to delight in after he had gone. She was ready
to love in secret, but he must not know that yet. Then,
in this new light, she was suddenly afraid for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you quite sure there’s no danger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The danger,” he said slowly, “is to the man who
committed the crime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a little silence till instinctively they turned
to other things. It was a strange talk, of the lips and
mind only, veering sometimes to ground where as yet it
was trespass to enter, and just as often diverted with
a deftness that only added to the growing reality of
what they both felt but must not declare. He studied
the girl, wanting her the more as moments passed, finding
in her the charm that is beyond explanation, delighting
in her perception, caressing her with the arms of his
spirit, and wondering a little at the strangeness of his
own voice. Often in days to come they would remember
this meeting and smile at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Jean, timid lest she show what must not yet be
shown, discovered in him a companion of her fancy,
a swift interpreter, creative, sensitive, and ambitious,
whose nature was fresh and unexhausted. She did not
realize how secluded a life had been hers. She only
knew that never before had she met a man just like
this. And, above all, he made her feel safe.</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>He walked thoughtfully back to Beech Lodge and,
approaching the gates, unconsciously slackened his pace.
He pictured the jade god in its hidden cabinet, ominous
behind the mellow oak, its creamy fingers resting on its
rigid miniature knees. Who had lifted this thing from
the place where it should be, and where was that place?
It had brought death to Millicent. What would it bring
to others? He pictured Perkins, haunting the room of
tragic memory that would not let her go. How much
more did Perkins see than that to which she had sworn?
He pictured Martin, his thick fingers among the rose-trees.
What was written on the screen of Martin’s
mind, what had jerked him out of the jungle, and why
should fear be written on his swarthy face at sight of
the stranger of that morning? How could he fear a
man he did not know? But he did know him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pondering this last, and with the cottage but a few
yards ahead, Derrick thought he could hear voices, and
stepped close against the high hedge that fronted the
grounds of Beech Lodge. Peering through this, he
could make out the window of the cottage kitchen, and
it was from here that the voices came. There was a
little stirring of wind that made it difficult to distinguish
anything clearly, but even at this distance it was evident
that some kind of heated argument was in progress.
Martin was speaking with a stubborn sort of rasp in his
tones that carried with it a queer suggestion of nervousness,
while the other man talked with a contemptuous
lift in his voice as though he reminded the gardener of
things he had culpably forgotten. Coming as close as
he dared, and, leaning tensely forward, Derrick listened.
He could not understand one word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men were using some unknown language, sometimes
sharp, sometimes liquid, shooting it out with a
speed that showed complete familiarity. Into Derrick’s
brain flashed his sister’s description of how Perkins
had talked in her sleep, and he knew that this was
the same tongue. Breathless at the discovery, he listened
the more intently. Martin was rapidly getting
on the defensive, jabbering a jargon of defiance, in
which, however, fear seemed always present. Derrick
started at the sound of his own name, then Millicent’s,
then Thursby’s. The word “Buddha” was repeated,
but always linked to some unintelligible prefix, and
never with the usual respect accorded to the god by the
Oriental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What the peddler now said appeared to take the form
of some kind of pronouncement as though he were delivering
a verdict, framed almost in a mysterious chant
that sounded as though it came from an infinite distance.
In the middle of this Martin burst forth in a
great English oath, to which the stranger replied with
one word that came like the hiss of a snake, whereat
Martin choked audibly and fell silent. Then Derrick,
his brain working like an engine, stepped back on the
road, strolled on to the gate at his usual pace, and, turning
in, went casually on to the house. No sooner
had his foot touched the gravel than instantaneous
silence spread in the cottage. And at that he smiled
grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing directly to the study, he closed the door and,
making sure he was not observed from the lawn, opened
the oak panel. Inside was the jade god and its waxen
copy. Weighing these in either hand, he deliberated
a moment; then, putting the original back, he closed
the cabinet and dropped the model into his pocket.
From the top drawer of the big desk he took a small
automatic. Finally, with god and gun balancing each
other in their concealment, he lit his pipe and strolled
back toward the cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time he knew he was observed, for, as he neared
the gates, Martin emerged from the front of the cottage
and touched his cap. His face was of a curiously mottled
appearance, and betrayed signs of great tension,
but as his eyes met those of his master he pulled himself
together and assumed his ordinary gruff though respectful
manner. Derrick nodded affably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Martin, what do you think of those Lady
Hillingdons for next year? I see you’ve been at
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They promise well, sir, but I don’t think so much of
the Richmonds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry to hear that. Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing, they weren’t properly pruned last
winter, and for another the mildew’s been at them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t seem to think much of the man who was
here last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t, sir, and that’s a fact!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what do you make of your visitor of this
morning? Does he know anything about flowers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, flowers aren’t exactly in his line from what
I make of him. Queer sort of chap, I should say, but
I don’t take it there’s any harm in him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He told me he came from the East. Does he know
any of the parts you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never happened to come across him before, did
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stiffened ever so slightly. “No, sir, never
set eyes on him. The East is a big bit of country, and
there’s room for all kinds there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know some foreign lingos?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, a trader needs them if he’s going to do
any business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you tried your friend in that respect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tackled him just now with Hindustani, but that
beat him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would beat me, too. Does he know any Malay?”
Derrick smiled a little. “Not that I know any myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a word or two, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curious that two traders like you, both of whom
have lived in the Orient, should have to fall back on
English to converse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s eyes were unfathomable, and Derrick
searched his mind for the next move. The man had
twice been proved a liar, but the object of his lies was
as remote as ever. Then suddenly came the thought of
Perkins, babbling what was probably Malay in her
dream-haunted sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if Perkins happens to know any of those
Eastern lingos?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s face underwent a swift change. There
was fear in it now. He ground his heel nervously into
the soil, while the big fingers clenched tight. There
was in his manner that which suggested a new anxiety,
and for the moment he seemed oddly helpless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t say, Mr. Derrick, but if I may make so
bold, I wouldn’t try. She’s a queer woman, and”—here
he touched his forehead meaningly—“she’s best
left alone. Mr. Millicent never bothered her, and he
knew her well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded. “You may be right. Where are
you putting your visitor to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the floor in the kitchen, sir; he says that’s good
enough for him. He’s about used up and asked if he
might rest for another day or two. Showed me his
feet. They’re in bad shape. I told him it was for you
to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick felt a quickening of his pulse. Once again
everything fitted in. The peddler would stay, but not
on account of sore feet. He pressed his fingers against
the image in his pocket, but his mind sped to the dark
recess where the real god stared malevolently into the
darkness and waited till his servants should gather at
his baffling summons. Then he glanced at Martin, experiencing
a throb of pity for one who was so secretly
tortured. He began to see how the man must already
have suffered, anticipating the inevitable, paying in
advance, with the pangs of two years, part of the price
of a blow that took place in a second. But there was
no room now for compassion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you happen to see the inside of the peddler’s
pack?” he asked carelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin shook his head. “No, sir, he won’t trouble
to show that to the likes of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know! I’d ask him if I were you, and have
a look at them. They’ll probably remind you of a
good many places you ought to know. Also I think
I’d keep an eye on him to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s all right so far as that’s concerned,” put in the
gardener hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may be, but one can never tell. I fancy he
wouldn’t mind picking up anything portable, especially
if it happened to be in his own line. One can never be
sure about men like that. I’ve known them to wander
about the country picking up odds and ends that were of
no value to most people, but of particular interest to
others. I’ve half a mind to send him along to the
village as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be all right, sir,” put in Martin hurriedly;
“he’s a harmless old soul with not as much strength as
a cat. I’ll stand good for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke with great earnestness and unconsciously
raised his voice. Derrick at this moment felt his gaze
drawn toward the cottage and, glancing over Martin’s
shoulder, noted that at one of the tiny windows of the
kitchen the blind had been drawn slightly aside. The
window was open. Pitching his own tones a little
higher, he looked straight into Martin’s troubled eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember that talk we had about Mr. Millicent’s
death the first night you came to see me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” replied the gardener with reluctance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve said nothing about it since then, but I’ve
thought a good deal. What about you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t forget it, either, Mr. Derrick, but what else
is there to be said? I told you what I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I take it that nothing has occurred to you
since?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What could occur, sir? It’s more than two years
ago now. The poor gentleman’s cold in his grave, and
the world has moved on. I’m trying to forget it as
hard as I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know, but sometimes, Martin, when a man
comes back to a well-known place which is associated
with an event like that, the mind takes a curious turn
and pitches on something it did not see before. It’s
almost as though the place had kept something up its
sleeve to reveal later on. Perhaps it’s your friend’s
arrival that has started me thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin sent him an indescribable glance. “I don’t
quite follow, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was wondering,” went on Derrick in the same
clear tones, “whether it was possible that any one answering
to the description of this stranger had been
hanging about the night Mr. Millicent was killed.
Things like that have been known to happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake don’t talk that way, sir.” Martin’s
face was now desperate, and he glanced apprehensively
over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick smiled reassuringly. “I can’t see that
there’s any harm done by mentioning it, and it might
be as well to let your friend know that we’re not
asleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man winced as though struck. “Mr. Derrick,
sir, if there’s anything you want to say about Mr.
Millicent now, couldn’t we go a few steps up the drive?
It isn’t wise, is it, that this fellow should know anything
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with you, Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, sir, but I can’t help being upset when I
talk about the thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick hesitated, then thrust the probe still deeper.
“I can’t see what difference would be made if he did
learn of it. However, let that go, and perhaps you’re
right. You remember my asking you if anything was
missed at that time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, and I told you all I knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the motive for the crime is as much a mystery
to you as ever?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s lips were trembling now, and he could only
nod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I had a chat the other day with a man who
was on the case, and he told me that another thing,
not that creese, was missed and has never been seen
since. It was a sort of image, carved in jade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heard of that, sir,” stammered Martin
thickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and apparently it had been picked up by Mr.
Millicent in the East years before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin made a convulsive gesture. “Please, sir,”
he begged, “don’t talk like that here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simultaneously his gaze was drawn to the cottage
window as though by mesmeric power. It seemed that
now he had ceased to feel anything except a mounting
fear that struck to his very heart. Little tremors ran
through his massive frame, and he began to sway with
a slow, rhythmic motion as if endeavoring to maintain
his balance. His face was a changing mask in which
there was not so much of guilt as of a deadly recognition
that he was being overtaken by some remorseless
destiny from which there was no escape. No longer a
gardener, a pruner of rose-trees, or a traveler from far
countries. He became in that moment a man under a
curse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Derrick felt a fleeting pang of pity for such
torture, but remembered the triangle of death, with
Martin standing at one corner. At the same time he
sensed the strangeness of the situation, in which he, a
dweller in a quiet country-side, should be inextricably
involved in a problem so grim and unexpected. Might
it be some period of fantasy or subconscious phase
from which he would presently awaken? To this there
were two apparent answers. One, the faint tingle that
seemed to spread from the thing hidden in his clenched
hand. The other, the picture of a girl waiting, waiting.
At that, all thought of compassion vanished
from his mind. It was real, all real, and destiny was
at work in Beech Lodge. Then in a flash the next
move became clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” he said slowly, “if this was the sort of
thing that was missed from the desk?” He took the
image from his pocket and balanced it openly in the
palm of his hand. “Of course,” he added, fixing
Martin with a steady eye, “you can’t tell me, because
you say you never saw it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gardener’s figure seemed to shrink visibly, and
his eyes protruded. He made a choking sound, the
blood rushed in a mottled flood to his cheeks, and the
big hands clasped and unclasped mechanically. Derrick,
staring at him, felt a throb of triumph and slid
the image out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God!” said Martin chokingly. “Oh, God! Where
did you get that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he swung round and glared at the cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the door came the figure of the peddler, and
Martin, watching him, made a gesture of despair foreign
to so powerful a man. The stranger’s eyes were
preternaturally bright, and there was now no trace of
the weary limp with which he had moved only a few
hours ago. His head was erect, the bent shoulders
were straight, his body was lithe and had taken on
something of the springy contours of youth. Instinctively
Derrick’s fingers tightened round the image,
but it was at him rather than at his pocket that Blunt
looked first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, sir,” he began, “but when I was smoking
inside just now I couldn’t help hearing you say
that some one had been killed in your house. Might I
ask who it was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The audacity of the thing made Derrick blink. He
could not trust himself to glance at Martin but knew
that the gardener’s eyes were fixed intently on the
peddler’s face. There followed an instant of silence.
Derrick realized that he was hunting big game, the
biggest game of all, and it behooved him to keep his
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell me first why the matter is of any interest
to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blunt’s lips formed an inscrutable smile, but his gaze
was as blank as sea-water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s of no more interest than anything else of the
same kind, but I’ve seen a bit of that sort of thing in
the East, and it may be I can be of use in getting at the
bottom of it, if that’s not been done yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick pondered. “This was not the usual kind of
sudden death, and there were no clues left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man nodded understandingly. “There ain’t so
many deaths of what you would call the usual kind
where I come from, either, but there is most always a
clue of some sort if one knows where to look. That’s
a matter of instinct. Can’t explain it, but I reckon
I’ve got it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over Martin’s features crept a shade of admiration.
Derrick saw this, and it stiffened his resolution. The
hunt was afoot now, one against two. Soon, he was
convinced, it would be one against three, when Perkins
joined in. She would prove perhaps the most elusive
of all. Then his mind jumped back to the man in
front of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how a complete stranger could spot at
first sight anything that skilled detectives failed to discover
after very close examination,” he said coolly.
“You’ll have to convince me that it’s something more
than mere curiosity on your part before I go any
further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And against that there’s such a thing as looking at
some object for so long that after a while one doesn’t
see it at all. It’s the fresh eye that picks things up.
Would it surprise you if I said that you’ve got something
close to you at this minute that might be a clue,
and you never guess it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin drew in his breath sharply, but Derrick’s
eyes never left the stranger’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that a rather wild shot of yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be, but I’ll risk it. I reckon I’ve sucked in
something from the places I’ve been in that helps to get
under the skin at times. Getting back to clues, this
world is full of clues that go unnoticed just because
people don’t know how to look at them. Same thing
when you get so used to a thing that you can’t tell
whether it’s in the room or not, without making sure.
That’s because you don’t hear what it says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” put in Derrick swiftly, “then you believe that
things talk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the only talk worth listening to now and then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick’s pulse quickened. “Is that what you depend
on in this case?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peddler nodded. “Perhaps it would surprise
you if I said that something was talking at this very
minute, a queer kind of stuff that I only half get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saying this, he lifted his eyes, and sent Derrick an
extraordinary look. There was power in it, and a certain
mesmeric weight, and in a strange but unmistakable
fashion it invited the young man to acknowledge
what he himself believed. This look stated very
plainly that the stranger saw through Derrick’s camouflage,
and also quite understood the present necessity
for it; but it suggested, too, that behind the newcomer
was an authority that as yet he had no intention to disclose.
There were no words in which to phrase what
Derrick felt. Presently, and as though to make the
thing as easy as possible for the master of Beech Lodge,
the little man gave a short laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might as well let me try it, sir. If I fail there
will be no harm done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick, without realizing it, took his cue. “Well,”
he said good-humouredly, “at any rate, you can’t do
much harm by having a look at the room. What do
you say, Martin? I’ll let you decide, since you’re responsible
for Blunt while he’s here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin twisted his lips in a vain effort to speak, but
it seemed that any reminder of responsibility was
almost too much for him. He shot the peddler a swift
glance, in which fear and respect were mingled, and
when he looked at his master his eyes implored that he
be not further involved. In that moment Martin acted
like an honest man. Then the expression passed, and
his face was once more a mask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just as you feel about it, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick turned to Blunt. “Well, then, you can come
up, say, at six o’clock, and you’d better bring Martin
with you. And, by the way,” he added, “if you want
any details about this murder before you come, Martin
knows a good deal more than I do, so you’d better
pump him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blunt shook his head. “It’s just as well I shouldn’t
know anything at all, sir. Sometimes the more one
thinks one knows the less one finds out.” Again he
sent the young man that extraordinary look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; but if you change your mind, and Martin
gets stuck, I’ll put you in touch with Perkins at the
house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin started at this, but Blunt seemed unmoved.
“Who might Perkins be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The maid who was here when Mr. Millicent died.
She found him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s expression did not change in the slightest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t want to bother her, sir; and look here, if
you doubt my faith you can take my pack till you’re
satisfied I’m straight. Anything else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice lifted as he spoke, and Derrick knew what
he meant. The sharp eyes peering from the cottage
window had missed nothing. The stranger was aware
that something lay hidden in that pocket, nor could all
his art conceal the hunger that was growing in his
soul. Derrick, his mind tense, and realizing that every
step taken now must inevitably affect the last scene of
the drama, gripped the image with fingers that felt
suddenly cold, then drew it out and dropped it carelessly
into the peddler’s hand. The man quivered at
the touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While we’re on the subject, there’s something that
may interest you. Ever see anything like it before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tremor ran through the lean form, and the bright
eyes became clouded with emotion. The brown fingers
closed caressingly, till, all in a breath, a look of concentrated
shrewdness spread over the swarthy face.
The man stared at the molded wax, then at Derrick.
“You clever devil!” was what the eyes said. He
grasped the meaning of this model, there could be no
doubt of that, and telegraphed an unconscious admiration
to the one who had fashioned it. He scanned the
small square base, the cloaked shoulders, the tiny folded
hands, and the hellish sneer on the pygmy features, and
nodded. Yes, it was all there, and nothing was there.
A great gulf yawned between wax and jade. But the
peddler remained master of himself, while Martin, at
his elbow, seemed rooted to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of it?” asked Derrick smoothly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peddler shook his head. “Of this, sir, nothing
at all; but if I could see the original it might be another
matter. Do you happen to have it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, but not here. And it doesn’t belong to me.
Ever see anything like it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blunt nodded. “Yes, but not often. The original
of this may have come from Indo-China, up northeast
of the Bay of Bengal. I reckon it would be about five
hundred years old. They don’t make them often nowadays.
These things sometimes drift down into the
Malay country, but they’re not supposed to. Look
here, sir, I’ve a leaning for carved jade, which brings
a good price from the Chinese, and I’ll trade you anything
in my pack for the original of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve told you it’s not mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe, sir, but if you’ll put me in touch with the
owner I’ll make it worth his while to sell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about that later. Why did you say that
these things are not supposed to get out of Indo-China?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me ask first, sir, if this ever brought any bad
luck to the man who owned it?” He paused and
smiled cynically. “I mean the original.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded. The daring of it was prodigious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it happen to be the man you spoke of just
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the odd smile, and the peddler handed back
the image. “It’s a queer thing,” he said slowly, “but
I’ve heard tell that the spirit of Buddha doesn’t like
these things drifting about. It’s talk of the East, of
course, and perhaps it isn’t worth much in England.
But there’s something at work in those parts that gets
hold of people without their knowing it. It isn’t so
long ago that I was in a temple up country where there
was something like this, and it just looked at me and
dared me to steal it. I reckon I would have tried to if
it hadn’t been guarded by about a hundred priests. It
was the same size as this, and just as ugly, and carved
out of jade, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All round it there were the usual images, but
arranged like rows of policemen. Next it was an
empty stand, and I guessed that that was where another
one just like it had been, but when I asked where it had
got to there was a hell of an excitement, because the
beggars thought perhaps I had it and had come after
its mate. It took me all my time to get them quieted
down. Queer sort of game, wasn’t it, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Derrick, in a strained voice. “Anything
else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had a lot of talk back and forth but didn’t get
anywhere. They seemed to claim that the thing was
a sort of link between what one saw and didn’t see,
and in a way joined them up to make a kind of general
picture. I didn’t take much stock in all that, for Indo-China
is stuffed with temples where they palaver about
such subjects year after year. So that, sir, is why I
happen to be interested in the original of this, and if
you could put me in the way of getting it I’d make it
worth your while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick glanced involuntarily at Martin. On the
man’s face had settled a look of utter hopelessness.
There was no sullenness now, nothing grim or repellent.
His eyes, at times so furtive, held only despair. His
figure was slack, the broad shoulders dropped, and the
big hands hung inert by his side. As though conscious
of his master’s scrutiny, he looked up and pulled himself
spasmodically together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Derrick, “I don’t know if the present
owner puts any value on the thing, but I’ll find out.”
He took back the wax impression and slipped it into
his pocket. “I don’t suppose this model really interests
you from what you tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peddler shook his head. “The copy is dead,”
he replied slowly, “but, from what I gathered in the
East, the real thing may have a sort of life in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll see you both at six o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man touched his cap. Derrick strolled on
through the white gates, and, turning to the right, took
the road that led away from Bamberley. Following
this a quarter of a mile, he left it abruptly, traversed a
neighboring copse, and doubled back along a parallel
lane. He walked fast and came to the village in a little
more than half an hour. In the tiny police office sat
Sergeant Burke. Derrick waved his hand, went in,
and took the proffered chair. Burke’s face was full
of sudden interest, but he asked no questions. Presently
Derrick leaned forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, sergeant, that an attempt at robbery will
take place at Beech Lodge within the next hour or so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke sat up straighter than ever. “What’s that,
sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll explain in a minute, but first I want to make
sure that, so far as the evidence went, no stranger was
seen in the vicinity of the Lodge about the time of the
murder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir. That seems to be without question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No peddler or traveling tinker had been in Bamberley
that week?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mr. Derrick, these people are all licensed and
registered, and we examine the license of every one
who comes along. They are under the head of itinerant
vendors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s an itinerant vendor at the Lodge now,
and he’s more keen on buying than selling. He
doesn’t make any bones of the fact that he’d like to
get hold of the original of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick put the model on the table, and Burke
fingered it curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neat sort of job you’ve made of it, sir. Weighs
about the same, too, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I put some shot inside the base and balanced
it with the other. It’s the other that my peddler friend
is coming to see at six o’clock. Martin will be there
with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did this fellow turn up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick told him all that had happened, Burke’s face
growing ever more tense, while he thrilled to the belief
that the Millicent case was alive again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t missed much, sir,” he rambled presently.
“Now what can I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At six o’clock those two men will be in the study.
Blunt will be apparently in charge of Martin, whom I
have made responsible for him, but actually I suspect
it is the other way round. From what I can see,
Martin is under Blunt’s thumb. Blunt will be asked
if the room suggests anything to him in connection with
the murder. He will probably pretend it does, and
begin some kind of queer story, which may after all
have something in it. I expect that he will in some
way involve Martin, and that’s what Martin is in such
fear of. At the same time, so far as Blunt is concerned,
I can’t feel that Martin is so very important.
It’s the image he’s after. Whether he can resist the
impulse when he sees the real thing I can’t tell, but if
he does not, that’s where you come in. The Millicent
case will then start all over again with an attempted
burglary, and I shall be in a position to testify that
Martin lied to me about the burglar. And that’s as
far as I can go at the moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke nodded approvingly. “Then you want the
grounds guarded?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in any way you think best. I would not
bother about the front door; it would take too long to
get out that way. The French window is the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trap will be set at a quarter to six,” said Burke,
glancing at the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick grinned contentedly. “It would be a bit of
a feather in your cap, sergeant, if you could pull this
thing off after two years.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch8'>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE POWER OF THE UNKNOWN</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>D</span>ERRICK walked quickly back, slackening
speed as he approached the Lodge, and reëntering
the grounds from the direction in
which he had started. There was a light in the cottage
kitchen, but neither man came to the window as he
passed. In the study he found Edith beside the tea-tray.
She handed him his cup, and with it sent an inquiring
glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s your friend the peddler behaving himself,
and what did Jean say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flushed a little. “She didn’t say very much,
but”—he smiled reminiscently—“she took the bangle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad of that, my dear,” she said softly. “Had
she ever heard anything of the peddler?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a word, nor has Sergeant Burke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been there, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “I thought it best to have a chat with
him. He’ll be here in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, has anything happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but something may, and I want to be ready,
in case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand, Jack. What do you anticipate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, our friend has an odd idea that he may be
able to suggest something that would help in the
Millicent matter in the way of a clue if he could see
the place where it happened. So I’m having him in
here shortly with Martin, who doesn’t seem to fancy
the visit at all. The sergeant won’t be in evidence,
and they know nothing about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” she said slowly, “can I do anything except
keep out of the way? I’ve an idea that’s what you
want me to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick laughed. “It is, exactly. There’s one
other thing. I’d like to see Perkins for a minute
before the others come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith got up. “Then finish your tea, and I’ll send
her in for the tray. She’s been even more queer than
usual to-day, so I fancy she knows that man is here.
Good luck to you, brother, and I’m so glad I know
what you’re working for.” She bent over, kissed
him impulsively, and went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat motionless for a moment, vibrant with the
knowledge that he was playing for great stakes.
Martin—the peddler—Perkins—the jade god—all
intervened between him and the goal of his desire. At
that his nerves seemed slowly to be turned to steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened. Perkins came in and busied herself
with the tray, and for the first time he noted that
her fingers were trembling. Something of the transitory
pity he had felt for Martin came over him, and
he made a gesture toward a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please sit down a minute, Perkins. I want to ask
you something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seated herself silently and sent him a blank
glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I want to inquire is something more about
Martin. Can you tell me nothing of his history before
he came to Mr. Millicent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should you ask me, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who else is there to inquire from? You occupy
just the same trusted position that you have for years
past. You’ve let me into your feelings enough to
know that you perceive things that are not usually seen,
and you’re aware that I’m doing what I can to clear
up the mystery of your master’s death. Shall I say
to you that I’m convinced you are trying to shield some
one in this affair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say that, sir,” she whispered shakily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What other conclusion can I come to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at him as though he was an intruder on
some strictly private domain and had come to rifle her
very soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think there’s any connection between the
murder and the arrival of this peddler?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins shook her head. She made no attempt to
disguise her knowledge of the stranger’s advent and
now seemed touched with the same helplessness that
had so lately swept over Martin. Her hands were
slack in her lap, and he noted their smoothness and
strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I cannot help,” she muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked straight into the passionless eyes. “And
yet you must know so much more than I do. Here, in
this room, the voice of a dead man is sounding now,
asking for vengeance. There are other voices, we
have both heard them, but this is the clearest. Here
your master died, and the evil thing triumphed, and
you told me that fear came before he died, the fear
that is worse than death. Can’t you hear that voice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blank-faced woman shivered as he spoke, and
Derrick knew that the truth had crept a little, a very
little nearer than ever before. There was mystery in
the study, but the greatest mystery of all was locked
within this unresponsive breast. There was some
chord which, if he could only touch it, would vibrate in
unison with her guarded secret and unloose its bonds.
Perkins trembled again and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was good to you, as everyone has told me,”
went on the steady voice, “and it seems that you were
devoted to him. For six years you had his confidence
and lived under this roof. I do not know what may
have taken place before that, if anything, but is six
years forgotten so soon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” she said brokenly. “Don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two men are coming here in a few moments,” he
persisted. “Of one of them I know little, and nothing
of the other. But I am assured that in the peddler’s
heart are things at which I have not guessed. He, too,
has his secret, or he would not be here. He poses as a
stranger, but something tells me that he is no stranger
to Martin, and perhaps not to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you say that?” she flashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It matters not why, but I have my reasons. It
may be that there are now assembled all those who were
here two years ago, and the Millicents are not far away.
One of these men was in the grounds of Beech Lodge
when its master met his death, Perkins; was the other
here, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shot out these last words in a tone so sharp and
commanding that the woman quailed visibly. Her
fascinated eyes were fixed on him in a stare that began
to be strangely hypnotic, till it seemed that she was receding
visibly from his reach, dwindling to a distance,
and leaving behind her only a baffling intelligence that
mocked and dared him to follow if he could. She had
recoiled, but with her secret locked tighter than ever.
He became aware that fear, though fear was in her
every motion, could not conquer her. She relied apparently
on powers that from long use had become stronger
than fear. When at last she spoke, it was as though a
safe distance had been established and her spirit had
caught its breath again. She seemed now safe from
further probing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have told you already what happened that night,
how I found the master”—here she hesitated a little—“and
then went for Martin. There was no one at the
cottage but him. There is nothing else to be said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Blunt,” he said again. “The man who will
be here in a few minutes, the man who is so anxious to
enter this room, has he never been here before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not Blunt’s keeper,” she parried. “I do not
know, but”—and at this point an extraordinary light
flickered through her dull eyes—“he may have been.
I cannot see in the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He made an offer for something this afternoon,”
said Derrick quietly, “something that seemed of little
worth to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him silently, as though in contempt of
his childishness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt in his pocket and leaned forward. “The
offer was for the original of this,” he replied, and put
the wax image on the desk immediately in front of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the next moment he snatched it away. Perkins,
springing with convulsive strength, had laid her nervous
grip on the model, her eyes suddenly ablaze with
mad cupidity. In a fraction of time she was transfigured
into a wild thing dominated by one uncontrollable
desire, and her movement had the swiftness of
light. Her hands closed like claws, but even as she
touched the thing her grip relaxed, for in that instant
she knew it was not real. She sent Derrick the same
strange look of baffled incredulity he had received from
the peddler, then sank back in her chair, trembling and
unnerved. Her gaze rested on what lay safe in his
grasp, wandered to the picture of her master, and round
the paneled walls, searching for what she knew must
be somewhere close at hand. The hunger in her eyes
slackened, becoming reborn again as though fanned
into life by this knowledge, till again she was almost a
demon, urged by some driving force, terrible in its
power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more the light faded, the tense figure slowly
relaxed, the face resumed the sphinx-like character to
which he was so well accustomed, and there was before
him the former Perkins, silent, mysterious, and remote.
She quivered as though from the storm that had passed
over her and, with her body limp, waited for what
might come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Martin want the real image, too, like yourself
and Blunt?” he asked deliberately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She remained silent, her lips pressed tight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what is this thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even while he spoke there came to him the certain
knowledge that in the emerald depths of the hidden
figure lay that which passed man’s understanding.
Nor could any man tell how this should be. The fact
was potent enough, and, as to the rest, it mattered not
when or why. The tiny god exemplified something
for which there was no explanation. It was absurd
to expect Perkins to make one. It rested in the abyss
that yawns at the feet of all, whether they see it or not.
Sometimes one might touch it in the darkness, only to
lose it. The thought of it imposed sudden silence in
careless hours and made the lips dry and the blood
tingle as it does when we feel on our brows the touch of
vanished fingers, and out of nothingness comes the echo
of a remembered voice. No, there was no explanation.
Perkins spoke after a stinging pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you find it? I mean the other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It found me. Can you understand that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded, her eyes still wide. “All the time I
knew it was here. I could hear it talking, talking in
the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been there for two years, and I do not know
how much longer. Did it send the fear that was worse
than death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else could have sent it? But it was not on
his desk when I found him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if the man who killed your master had captured
this as he hoped, there would have been no death
here that night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she whispered, “no death, and perhaps no
fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that the man who wanted it then may after all
be the same as the one who wants it now, and, having
washed his hands, he returns for what he then sought?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the sudden light in the baffling eyes, as of
torches lit in the gloom. Derrick saw it and racked
his brain. It was not an old thought that moved behind
the mask now, but some conception new to that
mysterious mentality. Were Blunt indeed the criminal,
and assuming his return to recapture his prize, why
should the suggestion of this produce so vivid a reaction?
If this were the truth, why conceal it? What
could this woman lose by coming into the open? She
would write herself down a liar, and an innocent man
be avenged. No, there was something else, and it
beckoned a mystical finger to Derrick’s imagination
and invited him on. The grim reality of the moment
fell on him like a cloak. In a few more clock-ticks
there would be others with whom to deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perkins,” he said evenly, “for better or worse this
matter must soon take another form. Two men will
shortly be in this room, and one of them in all probability
is guilty of murder. You know this, and I know
it. The hand of fate may descend suddenly and point
clearly, or it may be that the innocent may suffer for the
guilty. God forbid that this should happen, but it has
happened before, and sometimes because those who
knew the truth were not there to tell it or, knowing it,
kept an infamous silence. I ask you again, has Blunt
to your knowledge ever been at Beech Lodge before,
and, if so, was he here at the time your master died?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not Blunt’s keeper,” repeated the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick slid the wax image into a drawer. “Thank
you, Perkins. You’ve told me what I wanted to
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door closed behind her. Derrick did not stir
but waited till the last sound died away. The hour of
decision had come, and there was but one thing to do.
He took a glance at Millicent’s calm face, read in it a
mute approval, and, opening the invisible panel, took
the jade god from its dark recess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Setting it a little on one side of the lamp, he stared
hard into its pygmy countenance. There still sounded
in his ears Blunt’s voice telling of strange gods in
strange countries, and there came now the unforgettable
whisper of the East, with its mystery, its scarlet passions,
its swift terrors, its throbbing invitations, and
the jungle call of its fevered life. There was more
than that. On these miniature lips was set the smile of
sardonic knowledge and the curve of utter evil. The
lids that lay over the slant and lazy eyes were heavy
with slumber, but it was a repose that carried with it
no oblivion. Unnameable knowledge rested on the face,
a knowledge that sneered at good and gathered to itself
the wickedness of misty centuries. Here was the touch
of supreme art, the superb assurance of a master hand,
but the issue was to charge the mind with a blinding
comprehension of all that decent men most strive to
forget.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still staring, he yielded unconsciously to the spell.
Beech Lodge grew oddly indefinite. The landmarks
of his mind seemed unsubstantial. He was free as the
wind, with neither kith nor kin. He found himself
wondering why for months he should have been
possessed by the desire to avenge a man he never saw.
The tiny green eyes suggested that Millicent, and even
Millicent’s daughter, did not matter so much after all.
“Come East,” they signaled, “where man can taste all
the wild joys of life, and women know how to love as
do no others. Books, what are books? Dead things
and dusty against the curve of a breast and the languorous
hours of tropic nights. Good is ever the
same, and it is only evil that changes, assuming a thousand
lovely shapes, inviting, alluring, the wine that,
having tasted, no man may forget. Come and drink
deep while your blood is hot. There are those who
wait to show you the way, and soon it will be too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus spoke the jade lips; thus cajoled the jade eyes.
Even the milky fingers with their narrow, transparent
nails seemed to lose their stiffness and beckon, while
the blood deserted Derrick’s heart and the hair prickled
on his head. He was listening to the soul of the man
who had carved this thing, and what manner of man or
devil could he be? But, whoever he was, he knew,
Derrick felt that, and knew it utterly. Yes, life was
short, too short. Perhaps the jade god was right!</p>

<p class='pindent'>His brain began to swim, and the image now to
recede, now to approach, dwindling to a pin-point, and
swiftly enlarging till it towered over him, when something
drifted in from the outer world. He blinked
like one wakened from sleep. It was a tapping at the
French window. He got up and crossed the room
unsteadily. There was visible through the glass a
peaked hat, a broad, red face, and a pair of bright, inquiring
eyes. He breathed deeply and with a sudden
sense of relief. Here was something sane and strong
and wholesome. It seemed to dear away the miasma
that surrounded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stepped out and found the sergeant flattened
against the wall in a vain endeavor to minimize his
own bulk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got here as soon as I could, sir, and had a squint at
the cottage; they’re both there. Peters is behind the
hedge at the back. Anything new since I saw you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There may be a good deal. I think it’s likely that
the peddler is the man we want after all, and not
Martin. The woman Perkins declines to say whether
she has seen him before or not, also whether he was
in this neighborhood the night of the murder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good enough, sir. That ought to help. Anything
else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick glanced at his watch. “Yes, the sight of
the image produced on her the same effect precisely as
it did on the others. She, too, tried to get it. That’s
all there’s time to say now, sergeant. The men ought
to be here in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you armed, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I hardly think it’s necessary. You’ll be
able to attend to that end of it. Mind you, I’m not at
all sure that anything is going to happen. This is only
a shot in the dark. Can you see the image on the desk
quite clearly from where you are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Is that the real one? It looks somehow
more alive than the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick smiled. “Just what Blunt told me. The
dummy wouldn’t serve the purpose with him, so we
must take this chance. Don’t stir unless one of them
tries to get away with it. If no such attempt is made,
it’s for us to make the next move. I take it, sergeant,
you’re willing to work with an amateur a little while
longer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke nodded grimly. “I’ll follow any one who
can lead me to the man who killed Mr. Millicent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved back and out of sight. It was nearly
dark now, and Beech Lodge was encircled with ghostly
shadows. Edith had obliterated herself in her bedroom,
and was pretending to read. All she asked was
that this too serious play-acting be concluded as soon
as possible. It deranged the house and made her restless
and uncomfortable. Derrick manipulated the curtains
so that they hung partly open, revealing the
French window, then seated himself at the desk and
shot an oblique glance at the jade god. He was not
afraid of it but experienced no desire to stare straight
into those emerald eyes. He glanced at Millicent’s
portrait, asking mutely whether so far all was well
done, but Millicent seemed uninterested. What could
he mean by that? Then steps in the hall, and low
voices, and a tap at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Came Perkins’s flat tones saying that Martin and
Blunt were outside. She looked not at all at the image
but seemed to know it was the original. Whatever
emotion it may have aroused, she gave no sign, and
he marveled at her self-repression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, they may come in, and I think you’d
better stay in the room while they are here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flicker of surprise flitted across the blank face.
Then she nodded with only the ghost of a smile. It
seemed that she was not unwilling to stay, and the
smile was a little satirical and rather cruel, he thought.
But he remembered that she was not Blunt’s keeper.
In the next moment the men entered, their caps in their
hands. Derrick leaned back in the big chair. The
curtain was up now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blunt,” he said with slow distinctness, “it may be
that we are both wide of the mark in this attempt, and,
frankly, I don’t see how you can be of any real assistance.
It is only because you told me that sometimes
you had been able to get under the skin of things that
I’m making it. You understand that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peddler nodded, and for an instant their eyes
met. The man’s gaze swung back to the thing he had
been staring at since he crossed the door-step. Irrepressible
hunger and desire was in the stare. Derrick
seemed oblivious to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The murder took place in this room two years ago.
Martin has told you that, I assume?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, he has.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It occurred between nine and ten at night. Over
the mantel you will see a picture of Mr. Millicent, who
was found dead in this chair where I am sitting. Apparently
he had not time to make any defense. This
jade thing used sometimes to stand in front of him,
but it seems that it cannot have been there that night.
It is not known, as yet”—here Derrick paused for a
second—“how the murderer entered the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated an instant, then looked suddenly at
Perkins. “That’s right, isn’t it? It’s not known?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not as yet, sir,” she answered slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin made an involuntary gesture, but the peddler
wheeled and sent the woman a swift and penetrating
glance that had in it something of contempt, as though
he had caught the drift of her words and they actually
amused him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you tell me anything more, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, though it may be you know it already from
Martin. The weapon that is believed to have been used
has disappeared, a Malay creese that was always on
this desk. No motive was then ascribed to the crime,
but it now seems that this might have been robbery,
which was unsuccessful. No strangers are shown to
have been at the house that day, and not as far as
Perkins is aware have any been here till very recently.
No clues—and I take it that it is possible clues in which
you are interested—were left. Now you can tell me
if anything suggests itself to you. If you want to ask
any questions, ask them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bright eyes were fixed on the speaker’s face.
Martin was rooted to the ground but cast furtive looks
at the peddler, swerving from these to stare with a
dumfounded expression at the image. He had nearly
mastered his feelings, but there was a twitch in his
fingers he could not manage to control. Perkins, her
lean hands folded, regarded Blunt with a fixed and provocative
gaze, as though inviting him to escape if he
could from the net she was weaving. But Blunt seemed
unmoved. His keen eyes slowly examined every angle
of the room, scrutinized Millicent’s portrait with temporary
interest, then traveled to desk and chair, mentally
photographing their minutest detail. Finally he
looked at the French window, and Derrick wondered
if by chance he knew what waited outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that door locked at the time?” he asked after
a long pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick turned to Perkins. “Was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the front door?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not sure of that. Mr. Millicent usually saw
to it before he came up-stairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin started. “What are you trying to get at?”
His voice was rough and threatening, his eyes vicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For answer the peddler fixed on him a glittering
stare, whereat the gardener blinked and was silent.
Derrick caught his breath. The very air was now
ominous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything changed here since the murder happened?”
asked Blunt with a curious lift in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things are talking to me now. They’re a bit confused,
and all I can get is that this room may not be
the same as it was then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins put her hand to her throat. “How do you
know?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick leaned tensely forward. This was evidence,
new evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, Blunt. Tell me just what you’re after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, are things in the same place as when that
man was killed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight sound escaped from Perkins, and her nostrils
dilated, while Derrick caught a swift but meaning
glance that passed between herself and the gardener.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know; I never thought of that. Are they,
Perkins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” She spoke with a sort of satisfaction, not
unmingled with surprise. “And,” she added meaningly,
“no one else has asked that question for two
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you ask, Blunt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peddler seemed untroubled. “In a way, I was
told to,” he broke off, and regarded Perkins with absolute
composure. “What change is there now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The desk was in the other corner,” she said faintly,
“and facing the window, and this screen was on the
other side of the fireplace opposite the sofa.” She
got this out with a quick look at Martin in which she
seemed to expect his approval and almost thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then any one sitting at the desk would naturally
see out of the window but would not notice the door
without turning?” put in Derrick sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, it was like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Blunt, does all this take you anywhere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peddler came a shade nearer the desk. His eyes
were now half closed, and his dark features had
smoothed out till they were strangely inexpressive. He
might have been under the influence of a dream. The
silence began to throb, and over Beech Lodge crept
the touch of the mysterious East. None moved, for in
that moment the jade god asserted his domination.
The air seemed to palpitate, tremulous with unseen vibrations,
and a whisper of wind drifted from the puttering
fire. Then Blunt began to speak in a sort of
half-chant without color or inflection, his voice sounding
thin and clear and distant and carrying with it a
nameless note of authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see far away a picture of a place, large and poorly
lighted. Strange people are there, moving without
sound, and strange smells are in the air. Around it
there are many trees, and when one comes that way a
whisper runs ahead through the forest, telling of his
coming. I see a man not unlike this one”—here the
peddler made a gesture at the portrait—“but dressed
otherwise and with his skin dark like that of the quiet
people. He has journeyed from across the sea, drawn
there he knows not why, and saying nothing of the
purpose of his journey, because he himself did not
know it. Traveling slowly, and taking at times many
false trails, he comes at last to this place, and, staying
not long, goes away by night, but not empty-handed.
Behind him he leaves sorrow and a great anger and
fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice trailed out uncertainly, and a shudder ran
through the peddler’s body. His whole figure was
now swaying, and his head moved with a slow rhythmic
motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” said Derrick tensely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not far from this place there is another man, and
to him many call as with one voice, and a burden is
laid upon him, and after a little while he is not seen
there any more. Meantime the first man has returned
to his own land and the faces he knew best, and tried
to shake off the memories of what he had done and
that distant place. But he could not do this. Time
went on, and always in his dreams he returned there
and could not forget. The thing he had taken was his
master. At first when he wanted it, he thought he
loved it, and then learned it was not love but fear. It
was a thing of power, and stronger than himself.
Mystery was in it, and thereby it was able to give
tongues to that which could not otherwise speak. It
was a tongue for the dumb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded without knowing it. The world
was full of clearing mists through which he began to
perceive that which heretofore was hidden. His eyes
wandered to Perkins. She stood rigid, as under a
spell, her soul carried away by some invisible stream.
Martin’s furtive gaze had changed, and his face was
graven with despair, behind which moved desperate
possibilities. Derrick saw these and thankfully remembered
the man crouching against the wall outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Others had heard that voice, thousands and
thousands of them, and they too loved and hated and
desired and feared this thing. It was always like
this from the very first, because its hate had conquered
love, and the fear in it was at war with desire.
It had sucked in all that the hearts of men can feel,
and because of its wisdom, and because it was at war
with the spirit of Buddha, it had been kept close till
that day. But only those on whom the spirit of
Buddha rested might know the greatness and danger
of this thing. And it was written that should it go
from that place death would follow wherever it went.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in the unbroken monotone captured the
brain of Derrick, and the room swam. A mesmeric
influence was at work. Everything around him began
to slide, smoothly, imperceptibly. Was Millicent’s
death so important after all? Soon it would be forgotten—with
all else. What did he owe Millicent in
any case? Why trouble to waste his time on another
man’s affairs? Perkins, Martin, and even Blunt himself
became blurred in this general indistinction, merging
peacefully with other unrealities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So death came into this room, brother to fear,
following the steps of the doomed. It was in no hurry
but waited till fear had established itself firmly. There
was not any escape, and there could be none, and
the man who was to die walked between them for
years, seeing their faces whichever way he turned.”
The peddler waited an instant and leaned slightly toward
Martin. “So it will be with the next appointed
to die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins was as though turned to stone, and Derrick’s
breath came faster. There fell a stinging silence,
while the atmosphere seemed to hum and quiver.
Then from Martin proceeded a strange choking sound,
and in that second Blunt leaped forward. With the
swiftness of light he traversed the ten feet between
him and the desk and grasped the image. At the
mere touch of this, an amazing virility shot through
his body, and he darted like a stone from a catapult
across the room toward the French window. Derrick
tried to shout, but his tongue had lost its power.
Following a violent splintering of glass and wood, a
bull-like roar from Burke, and the lithe figure was
half-way over the lawn. Behind it lumbered the big
frame of the sergeant, losing ground at every stride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oblivious of the others, Derrick dashed out and
took up the chase. The jade god was in flight now.
He had drawn level with Burke when there sounded
directly ahead the noise of a struggle, a sharp whistle,
the curse of a man who is strained to the utmost,
and finally a strange, shrill cry. At that the sergeant
slackened his pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Peters,” he panted, laboring for breath.
“I gave him orders to station himself there behind
the hedge, and a good job, too. He’s got our friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick sped on. “Come along,” he shouted over
his shoulder. “He may need help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke grunted. “Not him, with a chap that size,
but the little devil pushed his finger into my throat,
and I saw stars. Make your own pace, sir, but it’s
all right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other side of the hedge the peddler lay flat,
the constable bending over him. The face of the latter
was flushed and the collar of his tunic torn. He saluted
mechanically when Derrick ran up but said nothing
till Burke arrived, breathing like a leaky bellows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what to make of this, sergeant. The
fellow ran practically into my arms before he knew
where he was and put up no end of a fight. He got
his finger into my throat and would have done me in
if I hadn’t thrown him. Then he got up and went
for me again like a wild animal. I got this thing away
from him, and he spun round on his toes, put something
in his mouth, and crumpled up. Now he looks
as though he were dead, but I haven’t used any unnecessary
force.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Peters; he’s not dead. It’s only bluff.
You can make your charge now, Mr. Derrick, and
we’ll run him in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charge? I’ve nothing to charge him with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke grinned. “Do I take it that he attempted
burglary and smashed that door by your request?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick laughed outright. “I’d clean forgotten
that already.” What he did not tell the sergeant
was that somehow he felt immeasurably younger and
happier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s plenty to hold him for a while till we
get at the real thing. This will be theft and damage
to property. Pick him up, Peters!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One minute,” interrupted Derrick. “Did he say
anything to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a word, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man did not answer but knelt quickly
beside the prone figure. A sickly color, half gray, half
blue, was stealing slowly over the peddler’s features.
His eyes, partly open, were glazed and sightless. His
body, so lately animated by amazing vigor, had
crumpled like a wet leaf. Derrick, feeling himself
queerly numb, slid a hand under the torn shirt. No
pulse of life was discernible. Close by lay the jade
god, its tiny malignant face sneering up from the wet
grass. The master of Beech Lodge saw it and
shuddered. Was this the next man appointed to die,
and had he been the prophet of his own passing?
Then Burke knelt beside him, stared hard in his
turn, and gave the white beard a strong and sudden
jerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came away in his hand, revealing a thin, oval face,
a firm mouth and chin, the face of a man not over
forty. The jerk had parted the lips, and these sent
out a mocking grin, suggesting that it was nothing to
Blunt what they did now. Derrick’s breath nearly
stopped. A new shadow fell across the body. He
looked up and saw Martin. There was a grim satisfaction
in the gardener’s dark eyes. It shot through
Derrick’s mind that this would free Martin from
further suspicion. Burke stared at him, too, then at
Derrick. He did not speak, but the same thought was
in his mind. He turned again to the limp figure in
the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks as though your friend were done for
this time, Martin. I’ll not ask you anything now.
Your opportunity will come later. Better give Peters
a hand and take this chap to the cottage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peddler was carried away, his slight frame
sagging limply between gardener and constable. Derrick,
watching this, yielded to a vivid realization of
the immutability of fate. Ten minutes ago this
man was charged with life, throbbing with a desire
that he hugged to his soul, and for which he had
journeyed from a mysterious country, forgetting all
else in one supreme ambition. Now the thing that
had driven him thus far had struck its own ambassador,
the next appointed to die, and the thing itself
leered up from the ground at his feet, malevolent,
devilish, and seemingly yet unsatiated. Derrick
picked up a stone and was about to splinter the sneering
jade when something flickered in the green eyes,
mocking and immune, warning him that the time was
not yet. Presently he felt that Burke was regarding
him with broad amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I may say so, sir, I wouldn’t smash it yet.
We’ll need it for evidence, and if possible I’d like to
hear what Perkins and your gardener have to say
about the thing. Shall I take it to the station?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick stiffened. “No, thanks,” he said abruptly.
“I’ll look after it till it’s needed. I think perhaps it
feels more at home at the Lodge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked up the jade god from the ground, dropped
it in his pocket as though the touch burned him, and
went slowly across the lawn beside Burke. Passing
the house, he saw Edith at a bedroom window and
waved her a cheery greeting. She signaled back, and
he noticed that she smiled with relief. What a standby
she had been, he reflected. In a flash his thoughts
sped to Jean. He had not seen Perkins, but the
woman was at the study window, her hands at her thin
breast, a sort of ecstatic joy in her sallow face. So
on to the cottage, where the peddler’s body had been
deposited on the kitchen floor. Derrick regarded it
silently, and again that recurrent sense of unreality
came over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What next?” He turned to the sergeant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing at the moment, sir, till we get hold of
Dr. Henry. It will be queer to have him here once
more in the same matter. Had this man any possessions,
Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gardener gave an odd smile and picked out of
the corner a tightly knotted pack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was all I saw. It’s trinkets and such like,
but he didn’t show them to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has this not been opened since Blunt gave Mr.
Derrick that sight of his wares?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so far as I know. He slept in his clothes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke fingered the bundle but did not slacken its
knots. He sent Derrick a thoughtful glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not likely there’s anything else of importance,
and from what we’ve seen to-day we’re pretty near
the end of the Millicent case. Would you step outside
a minute, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick followed him, wondering a little. Burke
halted out of earshot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to say anything unnecessary in front
of Martin,” he explained, “but all we’ll need now is
what I’m convinced they are ready to tell us about
Blunt’s last visit. We’re in a position to use pressure
to bring out that evidence, and with it will come the
reason, which so far beats me, for their ever trying
to conceal the fact that he was the murderer. One
thing I can imagine is that he had them hypnotized in
some way, and as a matter of fact I began to feel
hypnotized myself when I was listening to that chant
of his outside the French window. Did you get any
of it? If it had not been for that I would have
nabbed the chap when he came out. As it was I felt
half asleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded reminiscently. “Yes, I did get it.
Anything else with regard to either Martin or Perkins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing to-night, except that I would not say another
word. Let this thing soak in, and it will do
the work for us. In a day or so they will both be
anxious to tell all they know. Now, just as a matter
of precaution, I’m going to search the cottage, with
your permission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. It’s practically empty. Martin only
brought a bundle, and I sent him a few odds and ends
from the house to make the place livable. Shall I
tell him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, if you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went in together. Peters had lit his pipe and
was smoking placidly with no concern for the thing
on the floor, but Martin stood, still staring down.
There was a kind of wonder in his face, and with it a
strange thankfulness. He was like a man who
straightens his shoulders after they have been crushed
by some killing load.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin,” said Derrick crisply, “Sergeant Burke
is going to make a search of the cottage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right so far as I’m concerned, sir, but
there isn’t anything here except what any one can
see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was that in his apparent readiness which gave
his master a feeling of solid relief. The latter found
himself glad to admit that for months he had been
on the wrong trail. There were matters still to be
explained, deliberate lies to be accounted for, that
secret search of the study to be acknowledged and justified;
but all this, thought Derrick, was mysteriously
involved with the potent thing that now dragged at
his pocket, and when the light did come no corner
would be left obscure. He remembered, too, that at
times Martin had looked like an honest man. And
did villains ever love roses like this gardener of his?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin,” he said, “you’d better leave the sergeant
alone while he’s making this search; he won’t need
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man nodded with the air of one who has nothing
to fear, cast another contented glance at the peddler’s
body, and went out. They watched him cross the
drive, hesitate a moment as though deliberating which
way to turn, then stand, his hands deep in his pockets,
staring down the road. Again Derrick felt reassured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sergeant, I’m greatly relieved about that chap,
even though I did bark up the wrong tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke rubbed his big palms together. “Well, sir,
it was a fortunate kind of bark just the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it’s turned out. Now while you’re making
this search could the constable go up and stay in front
of the house? Also, he might just assure Miss
Derrick that everything is quite all right. She’ll be
more convinced if it doesn’t come from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peters got his orders, and the two were alone.
Burke gave a broad grin. The idea of promotion had
flashed into his mind. Then he, too, indulged in a
long stare at what had been Blunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, I expect we’ve both got the same conclusion
in our heads now. Curious, too, how it’s
come about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that, sergeant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That we needn’t dig any deeper to find the man
who killed Mr. Millicent. That theory of a criminal
returning to the scene of his crime certainly worked
in this case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Derrick thoughtfully, “but what brought
Martin back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve an idea we’ll get that out of him in a day
or two. Have you studied this chap’s face, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick scrutinized the rigid features. They were
gray now, the lips still set in a strange cynical smile.
It was not the face of a peddler but had unmistakable
signs of birth and breeding. The head was well
shaped, the ears small and set close to a finely molded
skull, the forehead high and rather broad, the eyes
far apart. Nothing of the murderer was suggested
here, but much of the dreamer, the visionary, the
adventurer of sudden purpose. Over him was the
touch of the East, visible in the olive tinge of his skin,
the slenderness of hands and wrists, and the faint
blueness at the base of his narrow finger-nails. Derrick
pondered over the possible history of this man
with the build of an aristocrat and the insignia of
the Orient. What strange tales those fixed lips might
have told. But they were all his secret now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not a peddler,” he said, turning to Burke,
“and probably never was. We’ll have to depend on
Martin and perhaps Perkins for the rest of it. Are
you going to have a look at that pack of his?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was unrolled on the floor beside its late owner
but revealed nothing more than the trinkets Derrick
had already seen. The man’s pockets were empty
save for a knife and a few coins, and the clothing
itself bore no marks that yielded the slightest clue
to his identity. Burke made a grimace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve drawn a blank this time; now I’ll have a
look through the cottage. How long did you say
Martin had been with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something more than three months now, and he
brought all he had on his back. I don’t fancy you’ll
find much of interest here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant rooted about with a certain methodical
deliberation, finally coming to a small bureau, the
drawers of which he pulled open with the manner of
one who expects nothing. Martin’s personal property
was in truth scanty. He paused at the bottom drawer
and looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Matter of fact, Mr. Derrick, while we know our
dead friend is the fellow who held the knife, we’ve
got to admit that we can’t prove it unless we drag
the truth out of the others. Martin must know perfectly
well that he’s up against a sort of third degree
examination, and what convinces me that he’s ready
to give us the inside of this thing is that already he’s
looking almost cheerful. And if he weakens, that
woman Perkins will weaken, too. I’m about finished
here now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He jerked open the last drawer as he spoke, jerked
so strongly that it came out on the floor. Like the
others it was empty. But between the bottom of
it and the floor itself lay a small bundle of dirty shirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your man isn’t what you’d call exactly a careful
housekeeper. He needs a wife.” He picked up the
bundle between thumb and forefinger. “Look at
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Came a dull knock, a clatter on the floor, and a
knife with a broad, curved blade a foot long and a
strangely carved handle slid across the floor and rested
almost touching the lifeless palm of the peddler. The
big man drew in his breath with a great gust and
stood glowering. His eyes met Derrick’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call in your gardener!” he said huskily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick’s brain was in a whirl. He stared back
and, not trusting himself to speak, tapped at the window.
He could see Peters pacing slowly up and down
in front of the Lodge, and Martin, who was still standing
in the same place, apparently plunged in thought.
The latter turned at the sound, mechanically touched
his cap, and came slowly back. The sergeant nodded,
put his hand in his pocket, and stepped a little on one
side of the door. A shadow darkened the threshold,
and as the gardener crossed it a grasp of iron fastened
on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John Martin, I arrest you for complicity in the
murder of Henry Millicent. Anything you now say
may be used against you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later Derrick walked slowly and
rather wearily toward the house, and Edith met him
at the door. For her the past hour had been full of a
drama almost too tense for her practical soul, and she
realized what it must have meant to her brother. One
look at his face was enough. She hooked her arm
into his and led him into the dining-room, where
dinner was ready. At the door she pressed his hand
for an understanding instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to say a thing about it, nor are you,
till afterward. Perkins saw the whole thing, and the
poor woman is happier than I’ve ever seen her. Congratulations,
brother; and now forget it for an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down with a vast relief. It seemed strange
that in the midst of this deadly game such matters
as food and cooking should proceed uninterrupted.
It was Perkins’s work, Perkins, who, outwardly undisturbed
by that which must have shaken her very
spirit, was still the perfect servant, the ageless domestic
automaton. He knew that Edith did not want him
to look at the woman, but could not refrain from
quick cursory glances at moments when she could not
detect them. There was really no difference, except
that the sallow cheeks had a faint color, and the lips
were a shade less grim than usual. For the rest of
it her face was still a mask, her figure just as unbending,
her movements just as measured and deliberate.
But what secret thoughts must be traversing that unlocked
mind, what emotions stirring in her breast!
And through it all she seemed not to know that he
was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, in the study, he filled his pipe, shot a contented
glance at Millicent’s portrait, took the jade
god from his pocket, and set it on the desk where so
often it had glimmered before. Edith scanned it with
an interest she had never displayed till this evening,
and sank comfortably into a big chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she said curiously, “aren’t you going to tell
me anything about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear, everything.” He paused for a moment.
“First of all, the thing is practically over, except another
inquest and what will naturally follow that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The last thing I saw was that poor man being
carried to the cottage. Then that nice constable came
up and talked to me as though I were six years old. I
did like that. But there was no real information
in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick laughed. “I’m afraid I did that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you had. Did you notice any difference
in Perkins at dinner? Isn’t her control amazing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much, except that she seemed in a way less
grim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she is. She must have suspected the
peddler all along, and when she saw him carried off
like that one can imagine what she felt—at least one
could if it weren’t Perkins.” She hesitated. “Is he
dead?” she asked gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “The life seemed to go out of him
when he was struggling with the constable. Peters
said he put something in his mouth—which was no
doubt poison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith shuddered. “How dreadful! It was the
fear of the other kind of death, wasn’t it? What did
Martin say or do then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, but stare and stare and look satisfied in
a grim sort of way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must have been something more than satisfied;
so is Perkins. This is probably the first evening for
two years when they have known peace. You remember,
Jack, I told you I didn’t think Martin was
really guilty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin,” said Derrick slowly, “is now in jail,
charged with complicity in Millicent’s murder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the door came a sudden and violent crash. It
had opened without sound, and there stood Perkins
with the ruins of coffee-cups at her feet. Her hands
were gripped together, her lips parted, and the suffering
of the damned was written on her colorless cheeks.
Her eyes, now large and staring, seemed to be fixed
immovably on space. Then, imperceptibly, she regained
a sort of shuddering consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m extremely sorry, madam, but I tripped over
the door-mat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice was lifeless, devoid of inflection, so flat
as to be almost unhuman. She stooped, gathered up
the shattered china, and disappeared. Edith, too
shaken for a moment to speak, regarded her brother
with frightened astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” she stammered presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly that. Neither you nor Perkins could see
what happened after Blunt was taken to the cottage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on with a sort of labored carefulness and
told her all, shooting meanwhile quick glances at the
door, where shortly Perkins would reappear. Neither
of them doubted that she would be master enough of
herself for this. In the middle of it she came in, looking
straight ahead. The tremor had left her body,
her hands were again steady, her face impassive as
ever. She put the tray beside her mistress and went
out. At the click of the latch Edith gave a gasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know such a woman existed,” she whispered.
“Till a minute ago she thought that Martin
was a free man and innocent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “Free, perhaps, but not innocent.
It was obvious from what little I got out of
her this afternoon that she was doing all she could to
divert suspicion to Blunt, without actually accusing
him. She was afraid of Blunt and wanted to get rid
of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why save Martin at the expense of Blunt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I can’t say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the only evidence you have against Martin
is that the creese was found hidden in his cottage
wrapped up in his clothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could that be called final and sufficient? Could
he be convicted on that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s enough to start with and puts it up to him
to disprove his guilt, and he can’t do that without
telling the whole story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith was unconverted. “He actually left that
thing, which may be enough to condemn him, hidden
in an old shirt where any one could have found it.
That doesn’t seem likely, does it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not, but there it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack,” she said suddenly, “that’s not the action
of a guilty man. How long had the peddler been
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a few hours, as you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why did he ask if this room was the same as
it was the night of the murder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been puzzling over that. It could not have
been a shot in the dark, and it laid him open to the
suspicion that he had seen the place before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, listen, Jack,” she said excitedly. “I’m sure
he did see the place before. Everything points to
that, and you’ve got the wrong man, and it was Blunt
who killed Mr. Millicent on account of that thing.”
She pointed to the jade god. “Can’t you see how
clear it is? He had some sort of hold over Martin
and Perkins, probably through that same horrid influence,
and they were afraid to incriminate him.
Two years afterward he turns up again, and Martin
was amazed and terrified to see him, thinking the
matter was done with. While he is with Martin, and
that was very cleverly arranged, they have arguments
which you overheard, and somehow he manages to
conceal in Martin’s clothes the knife, or one just like
it, before making another attempt at the image.
You’ll have to be frightfully careful now what is done,
or an innocent man may be punished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick looked at her, genuinely puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There may be something in that. Anything else
to suggest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m not a detective, but it’s the way any
sensible person would look at it, if I may say so. And,
yes, there is one thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d go straight to Jean to-morrow morning and
tell her the whole story. She might be able to help,
as it will probably suggest other things to her you
haven’t discussed yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick took a long breath. “I will,” he said.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ESCAPE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>T HAD been a cold night, and frost still sparkled
on the dank grass when Derrick neared the
Millicents’. He had spent sleepless hours picturing
this meeting, recounting all there was to be
said, and casting about as to how the story might be
put so as to revive as little as possible the poignant
memories of two years ago. It was a strange mission
that carried him now to his girl, but she greeted him
with a calm suggesting that she was not altogether
unprepared. Mrs. Millicent, unmistakably agitated,
pressed his hand with a nervous tremor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have more news for us, Mr. Derrick? Jean
has told me what you told her yesterday. It is all
utterly puzzling, and I wish I could help, but I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded sympathetically. There was no such
fiber of courage here as had been transmitted to her
daughter. She was gentle and patient, and her heart
centered on Jean, but she was not the woman to grasp
a situation like the present one. He wondered how
much Millicent had taken her into his confidence,
how much she actually comprehended of the real man
who sometimes seemed to look out of those painted
eyes, then concluded that this could only have been
fractional. She might have soothed his secret fears,
but she could never understand them. Her mind
was too ordered, her horizon too defined. She loved
as a mother, and mourned as a wife. That was her
existence. There could be no object gained in probing
this gentle breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, with Jean, Derrick knew it was different.
Hers were eyes that saw, and a brain that pierced beyond
the obvious. She had her mother’s charm but
her father’s imagination. Derrick knew, and it fortified
him to know it, that she could follow, pace by
pace, wherever he led, and that her vision might even
be keener than his. She, like himself, responded to
whispers from the unknown and was also undismayed.
So when he told his story it was to her rather than
her mother that the tale was recited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both listened in rapt attention, Mrs. Millicent in
sheer wonder, Jean with a keen and fascinated absorption.
When he came to the finding of the creese,
the older woman shivered, but Jean, her eyes cloudy
with thought, did not stir. When he concluded, he
felt that while Mrs. Millicent’s heart was lacerated
afresh, Jean was possessed of more profound and
vital emotions. And it was she who spoke first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very strange that the peddler should tell you
something I meant to tell you but forgot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s about the study. You remember, mother,
how it always was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The desk stood in the other corner, not where it
is now, so that father looked out of the window. The
sofa was between the fireplace and the window, and
the screen between the door into the hall and the desk.
Did the peddler seem to know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did not say so but appeared to notice that
things were changed. I asked Perkins about it then,
and she told me what you have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think that in spite of what you found
at the cottage he was really the guilty man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For one thing, he might easily have had that—that
weapon in his pack without you seeing it, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke off, and stared at the bangle on her wrist,
slowly drew it off, and handed it to Derrick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, I can’t wear it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded understandingly, pinched at the twisted
metal which was shaped oddly like a serpent, and put
it in his pocket. Jean breathed a little faster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, apart from that,” she went on, “doesn’t he
seem to you to have been the superior intelligence?
Your description of him is not that of an ordinary
man, and he seems to have very nearly mesmerized
those who were there, including the sergeant. Don’t
you see that perhaps Martin and Perkins are, or were,
only tools in his hands, and he represented to them
some power they had to obey without question. One
could then understand the look you say was on
Martin’s face when the man died, and,” she added, “it
would also explain Perkins acting as she did after
dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Perkins was shaken beyond words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, because it meant that though the peddler was
dead, the power behind him still operated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Millicent got up unsteadily. “Jean, dear, I’ll
have to leave you to talk the rest of this over alone.
I’m sorry, darling, but—but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went out hurriedly, and the girl was silent for
a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please don’t be upset about mother, and really
it’s much better.” She put her hand impulsively on
his. “Do you begin to see what it has meant to carry
the mystery and the terror alone? She could not
help me, and I’m glad for her sake.” She looked in
his eyes with such utter confidence and appeal that
he thought his heart would break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear, my dear,” he whispered, “you don’t
know yet how well I understand. It will take all my
life to show you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean turned pale, and from her parted lips came a
little sigh of content that, faint as it was, penetrated
his very soul. Then she breathed quickly, smiling at
him as though she thanked him for a perfect understanding,
and for knowing her spirit so well that he
could afford not to say more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it not possible,” she continued quietly—“and of
course it is possible; we both realize it—that Martin
was unconsciously guilty? I mean that not till after
it had happened did he realize what had taken place.
If Blunt could dominate him yesterday, why not then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stranger things have happened,” he admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if that’s the case it also explains Martin’s
helplessness and Perkins’ silence. She knows that
Martin did it while under this influence, while they
both know that, now Blunt is dead, the influence cannot
be proved. It would sound like a fairy-story in
court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded gravely. “All that may be. Does anything
else occur to you in this connection?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing about the others at the moment, but Blunt
sticks in my mind. You say he was partly Oriental?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had native blood. I’m sure of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he was probably occult. Father was, but I
have never told mother that. And death might not
mean much to him, as after death he would expect
his soul to live on in some other body. The poison
he took must have been almost instantaneous, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up suddenly. The big figure of Sergeant
Burke was coming rapidly up the narrow brick walk
that led to the porch. Hat off, he mopped at his red
brow. A bicycle stood against the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He seems very upset. Perhaps you’d better
speak to him, Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She used the word before she knew it and bit her
lip. Derrick hesitated a moment, sent her a brilliant
smile, and went out. The sergeant’s bulk filled the
doorway, and he breathed fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to find you, sir. Went to the Lodge
first, and Miss Derrick told me you were here.” He
gulped in more air. “A very extraordinary thing has
happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blunt, sir, has escaped!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick frowned a little. If this was a joke, it was
a poor one; if not, the man was mad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t follow you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just as I say, sir. He’s got away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dead man! Who took him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn it, Mr. Derrick, don’t you understand English?
He’s not dead—he never was,” exploded Burke
chaotically; “he’s come to life again, and escaped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick blinked. It was ridiculous, absurd, and yet—Burke’s
face was so red, his eyes so strained, the
whole great body of him labored under such excitement,
that his earnestness could not be doubted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you please tell me exactly what has happened?”
he said with slow and almost painful
distinctness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will. The body was taken to the jail at the
same time as Martin, and I sent for Dr. Henry, but he
was away at Eversleigh on some serious case. I put
it in an empty room used as a morgue at the other
end of the building from Martin’s cell. I examined
it before I turned in. It was just the same, but
colder, with the hands quite stiff, the face a sort
of blue gray, and no pulse. A little after midnight I
got to bed, knowing that Dr. Henry would come to
me as soon as he arrived. He was out all night and
didn’t get back till time for breakfast, after which he
went straight to the station. I had been back for
three hours then, saw Martin, who was all right, but
didn’t go into the morgue. When I took Dr. Henry
there it was empty—and that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke concluded this remarkable statement with an
eloquent and helpless gesture, looking at Derrick with
a sort of faint hopefulness that perhaps the thing
was not quite as baffling as it sounded. He was
grimly conscious that the Millicent case was reopened,
but not in the manner and with the prospects that a
few days ago were so comforting. His dreams of
promotion had vanished. Why promote a man to
escape from whom it was only necessary to feign
death? But all the signs of death had been there.
This and much more had jockeyed through his brain as
he pumped savagely up the long hill from Bamberley
village. His attitude now invited his amateur adviser
to suggest the next move if he could. The story
would be all over England in a day or two. And
Burke hated to think of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve heard of cases of suspended animation?”
asked Derrick after a long pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I’ve never seen one before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I, but they’re not uncommon in the East.
It’s evident that Blunt is master of most of those
tricks, but so far as my knowledge goes the suspension
is generally for much longer than a few hours.
This, no doubt, is the effect of what he put in his
mouth when Peters caught him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s as I see it, but it doesn’t help matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does Martin say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing; but I’m sure he knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s something in his face this morning, but
I can’t read it. I’ve an idea that Blunt must have
seen and spoken to him on his way out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick whistled softly. “That’s more than possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The point is,” went on Burke, with a desperation
he took no pains to conceal, “that if there’s anything
to be done, it’s got to be done quickly. If by to-night
we can fasten on something that will prove Martin’s
guilt, the matter of Blunt’s escape won’t be quite so
serious. If not, I doubt whether the discovery of
that knife will actually convict him so long as Perkins
sticks to the evidence she gave two years ago. That’s
how the matter stands now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to think a little before saying anything.
Are you going back to the station?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll be there in, say, an hour and a half.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant hesitated. “I might as well tell you,
sir, that I’ve already gone a good deal beyond my
official limits in the matter, but I’m ready to go
further, which means risking my job, if you can see
any light. I’ll wait for you at the station.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved off with no spring in his walk, swung a
thick leg over his wheel, and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick went back to Jean and by the tenseness
of her face knew at once that she had heard everything.
They looked at each other for a moment without
speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said slowly, “isn’t it extraordinary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she answered under her breath, “not so
extraordinary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all part of the rest of it. Do you remember
what I said about some power operating
behind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it just means that you are dealing with
things that can’t be explained by any reason or argument
or logic, and Sergeant Burke hasn’t the right
kind of experience for this. He’s fighting against
things he can’t see. He’s hoping now that Martin
or Perkins will break down and tell everything. They
won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t explain, though I’m sure of it. Does
anything suggest itself to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be done now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “Burke’s proposal seems to
be all there is left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think perhaps there’s something else,” she said
almost timidly. “Do you remember what you told
me some weeks ago about the picture that must always
be passing through a criminal’s mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, distinctly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the strange impulse to return to the scene of
his crime that he has to fight against? Well, let us
assume that Martin is the criminal and has returned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no question of that,” he put in quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not, but the picture he found was not the
one he had been carrying with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The study had been changed—I mean its arrangement;
therefore the possible effect that might have
been produced if he had seen the picture in actual
existence did not take place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” he said tensely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if on the other hand, and without expecting
it, Martin were brought suddenly face to face with
that picture, if the study were reset just as it was
before, and if”—here she trembled, and went on
bravely—“if he thought he saw father lying there as
he did see him two years ago, don’t you think that
something real and truthful might be startled out of
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove!” whispered Derrick. “Do you mean it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded. “Yes, all of it. I don’t just know
how I feel it, but I know, here.” She touched her
breast. “It’s the right thing to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate to ask it. And if it’s attempted Perkins
must know nothing about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she mustn’t; and, Jack, there’s something
else.” It seemed natural now to call him Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Jean?” He lingered on the word. How
near it brought him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes told him that she, too, felt the nearness,
but for the moment her brain was working too swiftly
to yield to aught else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the peddler. One can’t tell where he is,
but not far away. I’m sure of that. He won’t finally
go till he has that which he came for. Where is it
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behind the panel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if you do what I suggest, and to-night, it
should be on the desk beside you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beside me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if you—if you take the part of my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught his breath at this supreme courage.
“Would you come and arrange the study?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, when?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me settle that with Edith. I’ll see her at
once and then go on to Burke. She’ll probably come
this afternoon and ask you to dinner. Will that be
all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He longed to take her in his arms, but again it was
only their eyes that met—and spoke.</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was to Bamberley police station and not to Beech
Lodge that Derrick went first. He found the sergeant
in the little office, his face a map of uncertainty. He
looked up inquiringly as the young man came in.
The last few hours had been bad ones for Burke.
Then Derrick put the matter without delay, told how
the suggestion originated, added that he had agreed
that it was the next and best move, and waited for
the sergeant to speak. Presently the latter shook his
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare not, Mr. Derrick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop and think, sir. Here’s a man under arrest,
and I myself have charged him with complicity in
murder. I’m responsible for him till the authorities
proceed. One suspect has already escaped. Now you
propose that I let the other man out of custody to
try an experiment which is, well, Mr. Derrick, fantastic
any way you put it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly; but if you stop to think, sergeant, the
whole affair has been more or less fantastic ever since
we started. We acted on possibilities, not probabilities,
and you must admit we’ve dug up a good deal
that didn’t come to light before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do admit it; also that ten to one we’ve got
the man who killed Mr. Millicent. But I’m frank to
say that I don’t like what’s bound to happen over
Blunt’s escape. I’m only hoping that Martin’s evidence
will let me down with a good general average.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if you don’t convict Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I lose my job,” said Burke grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you have to advertise the fact if you did
personally bring Martin to Beech Lodge at, say nine
thirty to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man stared at him. “No, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then look here. I’m willing to see this last attempt
through if you are, but if you’re not, I step
down and out. I can’t give you any reasons for saying
that I think it will have surprising results, but I do
feel that. Admitting that you risk your job, isn’t
it worth while taking the chance of producing both
the criminal and the evidence? If you decide otherwise,
well and good. It’s going to be rather a thick
night,” he added, glancing out of the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke weighed the chances, his eyes half closed,
pushing out his broad, full lips and tapping on the
bare table. Yes, the night promised to be thick. He
saw himself, the guardian of Bamberley, sneaking out
of the village in the fog, a criminal chained to his
wrist, but himself the more agitated of the two.
Against this he was aware that ever since the Millicent
case had come to life things just as strange as
this had been going on. A man of order and law and
precedent, knowing the police code as a parson knows
the Pentateuch, he shrank from outlawing himself by
doing as Derrick proposed. But here again the consciousness
of something beyond the ordinary that lay
behind the Millicent case projected itself. He could
see the grin that would run through police circles
from John O’Groats to Land’s End when the Blunt
story came out, and recoiled at the mere thought of
it. Without something, as for instance a conviction,
to counterbalance that escape, he was done. And he
knew it. It was the vision of that official grin that
decided him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell me exactly what you suggest I should
do?” he asked heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First, say nothing to Martin. If you want to let
Dr. Henry into this, do so, but that’s for you to decide.
Fetch Martin to Beech Lodge at exactly nine thirty
to-night. Perkins will bring you to the study door,
which will be closed. She will knock, and there will
be no answer. Then she will naturally open it, and
you and she and Martin will see that room just as it
looked after the murder two years ago. I will be at
the desk in the position in which Millicent was found,
and able to give assistance if you want it. You must
not speak. I anticipate that Martin, or it may be
Perkins, will break the silence, but it is sure to be
Martin. His very first words should tell us what we
want to know. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke listened with strained attention. “If I did
bring Martin I couldn’t bring any one else. I mean
I couldn’t have any one on duty outside. The two
constables could not be allowed to know anything
about this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick, realizing that the point had been carried,
sent him a grave smile. “I don’t think we need
bother about the outside of the house to-night, but
that’s your end of it. All I ask for is you and Martin
at nine thirty. I’m not trying to persuade you into
this, sergeant, so drop it if you don’t think it’s good
enough. But it’s the only program I can suggest, and
I’ve no alternative.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke rose mountainously from his chair. “And
I’ve tried to tell you what it involves me in, which is
the risk of twenty years’ record and my present job.”
He paused, then gave a determined grunt. “But I’ll
do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded. “I think you’re right, and sometimes
a man moves further ahead in ten minutes than
in twenty years. Nine thirty, sergeant.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch10'>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A NIGHT OF TRAGEDY</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>T TOOK all Jean’s courage to go with Edith when
the time came. She had had a not altogether
comforting talk with her mother, in which, knowing
that it was unwise to tell Mrs. Millicent too much,
she only said that Edith wanted her to dine at Beech
Lodge and that she might be able to help Derrick in
his self-imposed task. Her mother assented, with a
curious glance that suggested that it was not altogether
the task that took her daughter to her old home. Jean,
realizing the futility of fuller explanation, said little
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was something of a help that Edith understood
so much and yet, in a way, understood so little. Her
sanity, her cheerful hope that the tableau would
frighten Martin into saying something that would
settle the matter, and the growing affection in her
manner, all combined to act like a much needed tonic.
Jean found herself talking more freely than she ever
imagined she could talk. She realized that this was
because Edith was aware what was in her heart, and
could perceive love, though the occult was beyond her.
And the difference between the two girls did much
to cement their friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The affair of that night was tacitly avoided, Edith
talking for the most part about that which lay nearest
her heart. This was Derrick. She did not grudge
him, wanting only his happiness, and the generosity of
her nature touched Jean enormously. Edith took it
for granted that whether the <span class='it'>tableau vivant</span>, as she
put it, was successful or not, the next important event
would be of a brighter character, and her contented
assumption of this had an intriguing effect. It was
strange to be regarded as a sister-in-law before the
word was spoken. She was still talking about her
brother, his art, his ambition, and the unexpectedness
of him that she loved so much, when they came in sight
of the gates of the Lodge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean fell silent as they passed the cottage, again
untenanted, and the rose-trees that bore the marks
of Martin’s skill. She recalled her last visit here, and
marveled at its outcome. These familiar windows,
this well-known door, and most of all that she would
soon meet the blank eyes of Perkins, all moved her
profoundly. She came to the house again not as a
visitor, or to revive memories of the past, but actually
to rebuild that past in such a way as to drag into the
open the secret of so many years. It was a crusade on
behalf of the dead, a high mission that involved putting
aside all else till it be performed. Though the
wound in her own heart ached, it must ache till the
mission be discharged. And behind that was the
whisper of love. It was this thought that enabled
her to meet Derrick with a glance of high resolution
that he found infinitely inspiring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking back at it afterward, she always wondered
whether dinner was not the greatest test of that
memorable night. In spite of their combined efforts,
it was very voiceless. Perkins, who glanced less at
Jean than at her mistress, moved silent-footed as ever,
blank to everything except her duties, and even these
were carried out with a sort of subconscious detachment.
She both cooked and served the meal, and
with the same unaltered perfection. Nothing in her
had changed, and as of old she made no lost motions.
She knew that Martin was in jail, charged with complicity
in the murder of her former master, yet no
sign of it appeared on her ageless face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But from her emanated something that made the
usual conversation well nigh impossible. Had she
shown her knowledge, the tension had been less. As
it was, Jean pictured her father and mother in the
chairs occupied by Derrick and Edith, heard the tones
of a remembered voice, saw the same trim, straight
figure moving with the same soundless precision—and
could hardly forbear to cry out. When, a little later,
she entered that other room of grim significance, it
was with a feeling that almost amounted to relief.
There was no Perkins here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick, whose eyes were unusually bright, waited
till the maid had disappeared with the coffee-cups,
then turned swiftly to Jean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we must act. Edith has given Perkins
enough to keep her busy till half-past nine. That’s
an hour. It was not safe to do anything here before
this, so we must move things ourselves, and if possible
without making a sound. One thing I want to ask:
was your father dressed as in that picture?” He made
a gesture toward the portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he always put on that coat after dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded, opened a drawer in the bottom of
the desk, and produced a velveteen smoking-jacket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought that might be, so rooted out this old
one of mine. Now we must shift the desk; then you
can arrange the things on it. In a general way, are
the contents of the room just the same?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly, I think,” said the girl, after a swift
scrutiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that French window, was it locked?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, always before dinner at this time of year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a curious smile, “To-night I think we’ll
leave it open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How stupid, Jack!” interjected Edith, “and let the
man escape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can’t, because he’ll be chained to the sergeant.
It’s with another object. Now are you ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean sent him a quick glance. She guessed the
object, and it made her heart beat faster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually the room assumed its former appearance.
Edith assisted with a businesslike, good-humored
alacrity, in the manner of a housekeeper who helps to
arrange a stage for young people’s tableaux. To her
these were chairs, tables, and rugs, nothing more.
She wondered a good deal why a practical man like
Sergeant Burke should be willing to take part, a man
responsible for the custody of his prisoner, then reflected
that it was all rather queer, and there was no
point in worrying about what one didn’t understand.
The consoling phase of it was her conviction that
this was the last act of the somewhat disconcerting
drama of the past few months, that it would soon be
followed by the wedding of two of the principals, and
then her brother would settle down and get on with his
work. The thing that really most bothered her was
the lease of Beech Lodge. She knew that Jean would
never live here again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as well she took her present occupation so
placidly, for to Jean and Derrick, especially the former,
the rearrangement of the study brought with it an
austere and growing significance. They moved in
the presence of what had been Millicent, recreating
a poignantly familiar scene, directed by the gesture
of an unseen hand. They were automatons, obeying
they knew not what elusive instinct. And it seemed
that as the room took shape it throbbed once more
with a medley of tiny voices, each thrilling its own
message in a fine, thin, vibrating tone. The chair
where the dead man used to sit, the desk over which
he leaned, the blurred stain that bore its cloudy witness
to his passing; all these became vocal, joining
in a mysterious communication which announced that
nothing is ever utterly dissipated or lost, but in some
form or quality remains, an imperishable record for
all time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nine o’clock struck, and Derrick glanced from the
French window into the darkness. The night was
profound, and over the country-side rested a great
blanket of fog. Putting out his hand, he could hardly
see it. Beyond was the world, populous with life,
lost and infinitely removed. From the trees bordering
the lawn came a slow, soft drip, sounding like a
vast, subdued weeping in this black obscurity. Anything
might move here and be undetected. All in a
breath he became convinced that there was something
close by. But it did not move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pictured what must be going on now in Bamberley
jail. Burke in his shiny cape, tramping down
the barred passage to Martin’s cell, handcuffs dangling,
grim, resolute, conscious of the desperate risk
he ran, his jaw like iron. How had Burke disposed
of his constables, and what kind of story had he told?
Again Burke, with his dark-lantern at Martin’s barrier,
the glint of yellow light on the gardener’s sullen face,
the brief word of command, the click of metal that
chained them together. Did Martin ask questions?
Was he surprised, or unwilling, or did he take it all
with his customary dogged silence? Then two burly
figures engulfed in the fog, the wet glimmer from
Bamberley windows—if Bamberley were not already
asleep—the scrape of heavy feet on the graveled road,
this strangely assorted pair moving up the long hill
beneath trees that stretched ghostly arms overhead.
What must Burke be thinking now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned abruptly, leaving the window ajar, and
drawing the curtains close. Crossing to the mantel,
he beckoned to the two girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I’m going to show you a part of the mystery
of Beech Lodge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He touched the woodwork, a small panel fell forward,
and inside gleamed the jade god.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that clever?” said Edith cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean did not stir. Her eyes, very wide open, were
fixed on the image. It was all very extraordinary—and
very simple. Had her father found this hidingplace,
or had he made it during the long evenings
he spent alone after it became imperative to have some
hidden shrine for his deadly trophy? Here was the
spot, so near and yet so safe, whence came the mysterious
authority that gave tongues to inanimate things.
Yes, the jade god was safe there. Again she looked
at Derrick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I begin to understand now,” she said under her
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith moved close and peered in. “I’ll have that
well scrubbed out to-morrow. It’s dreadful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick laughed. “Please wait till I ask it.” He
took out the thing and set it beside the lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It used to stand on the other side of him.” Jean’s
voice was quiet and steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, but that won’t matter this time, and,”
he added thoughtfully, “I want it to be visible from
the window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused, then sent her a glance that gave her
renewed fortitude. “Now I’m going to get into position.
Please don’t try and help me unless you feel
you must, and it can only last a few minutes. You
and Edith stand behind the screen, if you feel that
staying there won’t be too much for you, and above
all don’t stir till I do. It will all turn on Martin’s
first words. If anything happens at the window,
leave it to me. When Perkins knocks do not answer
on any account. Is the lamp right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pressed her hand comfortingly, and again their
eyes met in a gaze of perfect understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get behind the screen now,” he whispered, “and
don’t look at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put on the velveteen jacket and took the dead
man’s chair. Leaning his head forward on the desk,
the blurred stain was but a few inches from his
throat. The deadly creese was beside him. He could
see the jade god, its sardonic eyes bent on him, the
cruel lips curved as though they comprehended the
grim irony of the moment. Under that scrutiny he
felt once more the mesmeric power evidenced here only
the day before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edith,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twitch the curtains so that they are about an inch
apart. Then get back quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did this without a sound. Derrick lay still,
his eyes closed. He knew that a narrow rib of light
was streaming out over the sodden lawn and that the
one who hid there could view the strange scene inside.
Then silence fell. The tick of the clock sounded
heavy and fateful. Shadows danced on the oaken
walls, as they had danced two years before, and the
flicker of fire cast an intermittent glow on Millicent’s
face as it looked down from its gilded frame. From
a near-by covert came the soft hooting of a barn-owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint whisper from the outer world reached
Derrick, lying motionless with the blood pounding in
his temples. It was that of movement, not sound;
the merest fraction of movement, and transmitted
by the most delicate waves of air. His senses, tuned to
the utmost pitch, caught this, though it was no more
than the suggestion that the atmosphere had been displaced
not far off. Close to him some one had changed
position. That was all he knew, and by the quality
of this sensation he also guessed that the change had
been made stealthily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of this, and while the air seemed to
transmit a steady singing monotone, came a sharp
knock at the front door. He held his breath for the
click of the latch, presently catching Burke’s voice,
deep and husky. Followed a sound of heavy feet,
and Perkins’s tap at the study door. She waited a
moment; Derrick felt a slight draft and knew she
was in the room with the two men behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Martin came a strange, throaty cry, and from
the woman a choking gasp. Derrick’s hair prickled,
and all power seemed to leave him. Again the gasp.
Then flying feet crossed the floor with inconceivable
swiftness, and Perkins flung herself beside his chair.
He felt the grip of frenzied arms on his shoulders and
heard tones of unutterable anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Master, master, what is it? Speak to me, speak
to me! You’re not dead! I didn’t mean it. I
didn’t know I did it. I was asleep; don’t you understand?
And when I woke your blood was on my
hands. Speak to me, master; for God’s sake, speak!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant Derrick was unable to move. Perkins
crouched on the floor beside him, her body shaking,
her face buried in her arms. Another cry from
Martin, and he plunged, dragging Burke with him.
He put his one free hand on the woman’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you go on like that, lass. It’s only a plant.
You didn’t do it. I’ll swear you didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perkins staggered to her feet. Her eyes were
glazed. She stared wildly up at Martin, then at the
sergeant as though she did not see him, then at the
French window. The curtains had parted, and in the
gap crouched the tense figure of Blunt, poised for a
spring. At this last, her features became distorted.
All the suffering of the damned crowded into them.
With a motion of incredible swiftness, she grasped
the creese and plunged it into her heart. Simultaneously
Blunt darted forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What happened in that instant happened in a flash.
Martin fell on his knees beside the woman. Burke,
half dazed as he was, flung out his great fist and
caught Blunt on the temple. There came a cry from
the two who had been hidden behind the screen. Derrick
leaped up. He saw Perkins, her breast stained
scarlet, with Martin beside her, rocking in an abandonment
of grief. Against the wall, as though it
had been thrown there like a rag, huddled the insensible
figure of the peddler. Burke was breathing hard and
already fumbling at the lock of the handcuff that
bound him to the gardener. On one side stood Jean
and Edith, their eyes starting with horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment the sergeant got himself free with a
clink of metal. He glowered at the inert body of
Blunt with a sort of animal satisfaction, then, kneeling
beside Perkins, stared at her hard, and finally put his
big head against that crimson heart. Martin did not
move but gave one long shuddering sigh. A moment
thus, till Burke heaved up, his face very grave, and
made an unmistakable gesture. At that Edith put her
arms round Jean and held the girl close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take charge now, sir,” said Burke grimly.
“These two men must come to the station with me.
As for this poor woman, we can’t do better than
take her to the cottage, if you don’t mind her being
there till morning, and I’ll send a man up there as
soon as possible. And,” he added, “perhaps I’d better
take this knife for safe-keeping till the inquest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” Martin turned his grief-stricken face,
clutching at the officer’s arm. “For God’s sake don’t
do that. Let me stay with her,” he implored hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke stared at him. “What are you talking
about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t leave her in the cottage with any one but
me. I’ll be there in the morning. I won’t run away.
I’ll do anything else you like, but for God’s sake let
me stay with her to-night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke shook his head. “You’ll do what you’re
told, and do it now. What is this woman to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My wife,” groaned Martin, and burst into throttling
sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Utter silence fell upon this room of death. Against
the wall, Blunt gave a slow shiver and raised his
head, regarding the scene with a strange calm, as
though such tragedies were only passing incidents in
a still greater drama. He made no attempt to move
but lay there, resting on one elbow, part of it all,
but infinitely removed. Derrick stared at the two
girls. Edith’s arms were still round Jean, but their
eyes were fixed on what lay on the floor. Jean looked
at the man she loved. The terror was leaving her
face, being replaced by a vast incomprehensible wonder
mingled with a profound pity. In that moment she
was his, and yet unspeakably distant. It was like
traversing a forest of dreadful shadows and emerging,
suddenly blinded, into the light, where one had to find
oneself before seeing anything else. A great pity enveloped
her altogether. She came quickly forward and
knelt beside the still form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, you must ask the sergeant to permit that.
Don’t you understand? One poor woman among all
these men,” she whispered. “Oh, the poor, poor
soul!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke nodded. “Perhaps that will be all right,
miss,” he broke in with a queer, deep gruffness.
“We’ll let it go at that, but I’ll have to send a man
up to stay outside till morning. He won’t come into
the cottage. Is there anything you want to say, Mr.
Derrick, before—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick shook his head. “I think it has all been
said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant touched Martin’s shoulder. “Will
you—” He glanced at the body. “Blunt goes with
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin nodded speechlessly. With infinite tenderness
he picked up his wife as though she had been
a child and, staring straight ahead with unseeing eyes,
strode through the door which her lifeless hand had
so recently opened for him. Then into the hall alone
with his burden. The others heard the front door
open and close, and after that the sound of slow feet
on the gravel. This dwindled. Burke stepped across
to where the peddler lay on his side and snapped on a
handcuff. At the ring of metal, Derrick felt his eyes
suddenly drawn to the jade god.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing still rested, the light soaking into its
emerald depths, and it seemed that on the tiny features
rested a smile of sardonic satisfaction, as though it had
known it all, and all the time. What was any individual
tragedy, what was this minute portion of the
great human drama, with the pangs of a moment, to
the profound acquaintanceship with evil that lay hidden
here? These actors were only discharging their parts
in an endless play that would continue with its constantly
changing scenes so long as humanity could feel
passion and anger and fear and revenge. Derrick
stared at the image and vowed silently that, come what
might of his act, this reign of terror would soon end.
But here was neither the time nor the place. He made
a gesture to Edith, and the latter slipped her arm into
that of Jean. When he knew they had reached Edith’s
room, Derrick turned to Burke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to speak to you a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant crooked a finger at Blunt and led him
into the hall. Again the clink of metal, and the peddler
was anchored to a massive chair. The big man
came back, smiling grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a useful dodge when you think of it. Now,
what about this image? Hadn’t I better take it to the
station for the present?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick shook his head. “If you don’t mind, I’d
rather keep it till it happens to be needed.” There
followed a little pause, while through both their brains
ran the swift wonder of the night. “I suppose,” he
added, “there’s no objection to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke grinned. “No, sir; matter of fact, I’m not
in love with the ugly thing myself. It worked, didn’t
it? that plan of yours,” he went on respectfully, “but
not just in the way either of us expected. Who would
ever have thought it? As for that poor woman, why,
there’s only one explanation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke put a significant finger to his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” said Derrick suddenly, “I want to
know something. What’s the next move, now that
the matter is in your hands?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the inquest, perhaps to-morrow, but maybe
the day after. It depends on Dr. Henry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trial of Blunt and Martin, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what will they be tried for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Housebreaking, attempted theft, and possible complicity
in the murder of Mr. Millicent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then take Martin first. He did not break into
this house. I sent for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be true, sir, but you can’t say that for the
other fellow, and they seem to be in pretty close touch
and to have worked together.” Burke paused and
looked puzzled. “I don’t very well see how they can
be separated in this affair, judging by what you’ve
said yourself in the last day or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose, sergeant,” said Derrick thoughtfully,
“that I should decide not to lay any charge against
Blunt after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man blinked. “I don’t quite follow you,
sir. What’s to be gained by acting like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say yet, but do you honestly think there’s
any chance of really proving anything serious now
against these two men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a good working chance, but I fancy a jury
would be as much puzzled as we’ve been, and probably
more. You never can tell about a jury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I particularly ask that no charge be laid
against either of them till I have had a talk with both.
I admit, and you’ve said it, too, that all our suspicions
were wrong and unfounded. We were working hard,
but only playing about on the edge of the truth. Now
we have heard a confession of the act from lips where
we never expected to find it, and the person who committed
the murder has gone before another court. Our
discovery, which has led to this, was a matter of chance,
and we were on a false trail from the start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I admit that, sir, but you did all the guessing.
The only thing we had in common was our suspicion
of Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true, and I’ll shoulder whatever blame
attaches to it. But, officially, the net result is that
you have cleared up the mystery of the Millicent
murder, and after every one else had failed. You
mustn’t forget, sergeant, that so far as any one else
is concerned I’m merely an onlooker. I congratulate
you, Burke. It ought to mean promotion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other man indulged in a broad smile. He had
had no time to think about promotion yet, but the
prospect was distinctly rosy. “That’s very good of
you, sir, and this certainly ought to help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that now the matter of Blunt’s escape does not
seem very serious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, Dr. Henry told me enough about that
trick to show that it’s fooled a good many wiser men
than me. It has proved not to be important after all,
and I don’t think it will be brought up against me. Is
there anything you want me for now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to make the following arrangement. I’ll be
responsible for Martin till morning, and he will
then go with your man to the station. Meantime,
please understand that I lay no charge whatever against
him. As to Blunt, in that case also I lay no charge at
present, but reserve the right to do so to-morrow if I
wish. Meantime, I’d like it understood, if possible,
that you are merely taking him at my request because
I found him in my house without my authority. I
don’t know the law in such matters but assume that
you could not proceed against him till I did actually lay
the charge. As for the rest of it, I suppose they will
both be needed as witnesses to the confession and suicide.
With that, of course, I have nothing to do. Can
the matter be left that way for the next day or so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke pondered. He could not get much further at
present than that the Millicent mystery was solved,
and his own reputation not only reëstablished but enhanced,
and there was solid satisfaction in the thought.
Already he could see the head-lines in the London
papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said slowly, “I think we could leave it that
way, sir. When would you want to talk to these
men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Mr. Derrick. I’ll get most of my work
out of the way by ten thirty and be ready for you, if
that will suit. Nothing more I can do for you here
to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man breathed a long sigh of relief.
“There’s nothing left to go wrong now, and I’ll put
this jade friend, or enemy, of ours back where he belongs
for the present. Good night, sergeant, and I’m
glad your luck has turned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burke saluted and went out. There was the slight
jingle of a chain, and the front door closed. Derrick
pushed back the oaken panel. Involuntarily he glanced
at the portrait. Millicent seemed satisfied. He was
avenged now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then over the young man began to creep sensations
in which there was no triumph, no pride, no self-congratulation.
The blank-faced woman over whom
Martin was crouching in the silent cottage seemed to
rise up and point a thin accusing finger. Why had he
done this thing? Her secret had been torn from her,
and her life with it. What had she ever done to Derrick?
His lips became dry at the thought, and he felt
almost like a murderer himself. What was wrong
with his philosophy? Up-stairs was Jean waiting for
him. He would go to her across the body of another
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struggled with this picture, but it would not
down. By what trail had he come to so unexpected
a solution? Could it be that it was always thus with
those over whom the jade god held its malignant sway?
Were their lives at the mercy of undercurrents of
whose very existence they were ignorant? What did
the image mean to Perkins, or any of them? She
knew now, perhaps for the first time, but would he
himself ever know? Who was Blunt in this deadly
circle, and why should Martin and Perkins, being man
and wife, remain yet strangers to one another? Had
the jade god come in between? His brain rocked with
hazardings like this, and at the end of it all he felt
guiltier and guiltier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went up-stairs and found Jean waiting for him
in the hall. She had watched Blunt, swinging one
arm, disappear in the fog, walking close to the sergeant.
They had stopped at the cottage, where Burke peered
in but did not enter. He saw what he expected to
see. Blunt did not attempt to look. Then the two
passed on through the white gates and were swallowed
up. Jean knew that Derrick would now come to her
soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear,” she said, “who ever could have
dreamed of this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made no answer, for there was none, but the
look on his face gave her a new throb of fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” he said wearily, “but if it were not
for you I would regret having done anything. As it
is”—he made a helpless gesture—“see what I have
done!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has anything else happened?” she asked timidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, there’s nothing more to happen now. I’m
thinking of Perkins down in the cottage, and that it
was I who sent her there. I wish I hadn’t. God,
how I wish that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack,” she said swiftly, “don’t think of it that way!
Dear one, don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve done a woman to death,” he said in a half-whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no”—she was trembling with a great longing
to comfort him—“no one has. It was all written,
and had to be. I am full of the horror of it, too, but
you and all of us were only pawns. Perkins’s life was
utterly unhappy, and her death, however terrible, can’t
be more so. To me it all seems like some law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What law?” he asked dully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t explain. She killed my father, we all know
that now, but why we don’t know. Nor did she really
know why she should kill herself. You did not bring
her to her death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if I had not acted as I have she would be alive
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that his arms went out, and he held her close.
For a moment they clung like children, moved by
some common and half-understood impulse. Surrounded
by something, they knew not what, it was
good to be like this and touch each other in the shadows
of life. It brought Derrick a throb of divine comfort,
strange and new. It was his turn to feel not so utterly
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, and after that?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told her, and what he had arranged with Burke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad. Just think of Martin all these years,
how he must have loved her in spite of everything;
what it must have cost him to go away as he did, and
under suspicion, just to save her. And all that hidden
behind his strange and threatening face. It could not
have been anything he did that killed her love for him.
Jack, dear, I can only feel pity, all the pity in the world,
and you must feel only that, too. That poor woman
would not want to live it all over again. And, oh, it
does make me want to be understanding and merciful
when I can to every one, always!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A STRANGE CONFESSION</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE WHOLE earth, bathed in bright sun and
clear air, looked younger when Derrick
walked into Bamberley next morning. It
seemed but an hour since he had piloted Jean back
through the fog, and when they parted she had clung
to him for a wonderful moment that needed no words.
His mind was still in a whirl, and with difficulty he
pitched it forward to Bamberley jail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had been brought there in the gray of dawn,
and with him the body of his wife, which rested where
so lately the stiff figure of the peddler lay till subjugated
consciousness mysteriously returned. There had been
no chance to talk with Blunt, nor did Martin want to
talk. He had sat for hours, quite motionless, turning
the thing over and over in his slow brain, and it seemed
that from the truth itself there was least to be feared.
It was strange for him even to contemplate truth now.
He was innocent of murder, but he was a perjurer
nevertheless. He would have to risk that. Burke did
not speak to him, and the moments dragged inflexibly
on. But there was a new look in his swarthy face
when Derrick entered the cell in company with the sergeant.
He got up and nodded awkwardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want Blunt here when you question this
man?” asked Burke. “I’ll answer for it that nothing
has been fixed up between them since last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you see any objection?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re your questions, sir, not mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick hesitated a moment but felt persuaded that
already he had got far enough under the skin of
things to detect any probable collusion. He rather
wanted to see these two men together and see if he
could corroborate or disprove the story of one from
the eyes of the other. Then something suggested that
with death so near at hand there was little prospect of
collusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think Blunt had better be here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin gave him a swift glance in which there was
something that was almost gratitude for his confidence.
Blunt was brought in by Peters, the constable.
Peters’s face was full of an unbounded curiosity, and
he was unaffectedly disgusted when Burke motioned
him to withdraw. The peddler looked now not more
than forty, and only in the brightness of his eyes was
there anything of the bent and bearded man who had
opened his pack at the cottage of Beech Lodge. One
temple was swollen from Burke’s blow, but there was
no animosity about him. Nor was there any suggestion
of fear. He glanced not at all at Martin but sent
Derrick a long, steady stare. There was knowledge
in that stare, and a certain unshakable fortitude. Such
men in times past had died on the rack without a
whisper of confession. Their bodies one can conquer,
but not their spirits. Derrick knew then that what
Blunt would say would be the truth; as much of it as
he thought wise, and no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Martin,” began the former slowly, “Miss
Derrick and I and all of us are more than sorry about
what happened last night, and what I don’t understand
is why your poor wife and you should have
thought it best to say nothing to us of what you were
to each other. Even now I am not here to examine
you, I have no right to do anything like that, but just
to ask whether you do think it wise to say something
of your own free will. I think”—here he hesitated
a little—“that I’ve been fairly decent to you since you
came. As to your wife, she never said anything which
gave us the slightest inkling of the situation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man regarded him with unfathomable eyes,
and here again there was no fear. He seemed to be
weighing chances, and at the same time to be prepared
for any outcome. Presently he looked full at the
peddler, and Derrick noted that the latter nodded ever
so slightly, while once more there spread from him
that nameless atmosphere of authority. Then Martin
took a long breath and began in a deep voice, rough
and broken with emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve always been straight with me, Mr. Derrick,
and now I’m going to be just as straight with
you. I can’t help letting myself in for it”—here he
glanced swiftly at Burke—“but I don’t much care what
happens. What’s more, I’d just as soon Blunt heard
what I’ve got to say, and he can check me up when
I get off the track, if he wants to. I’ll start at the
beginning, and that’s about eight years ago when we
went up country in Burma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who do you mean by we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My wife and me. I had been trading along the
Irawadi, been there for some years, when I heard
there was good business to be done further up. We
were about ready to pull out, but I changed my plans.
Ever been in those parts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then don’t go, sir. It’s no place for a white man,
and less for a white woman. Folks seem to go mad
there without knowing it, a sort of slow, creeping
madness that by and by gets them. It’s the jungle
that does it, with the smell of the orchids like a
woman’s breast, air that thick and heavy you could
almost cut it with a knife like cheese, soft under your
foot with things dying and being born. There are
butterflies as big as your hat that go fluttering round
as though they were drunk with the smell of the
flowers, as I guess they are; and the flowers are like
pulp, with nothing to touch a Lady Hillingdon in the
whole country. It seemed to me after a while that
most every one is either mad or drunk in the jungle,
which is perhaps the same thing, but of course they
don’t know it. Anyway, it was eight years ago, no,
seven, that Mr. Millicent came along. He had traveled
up river to see the country, being interested in that
sort of thing. I was away still further up at the time,
and when he got back on his way to Rangoon he
stopped at my place because there was nowhere else to
stay. What happened there I didn’t know at the
time, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off helplessly, locked and twisted his
thick fingers together, stared uncertainly at Derrick
and then at Blunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” said the latter quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was nearly a year before I found out, but
when I got back my wife had gone, leaving no word.
Then I went mad, too, blaming myself because I had
kept her so long in the jungle and she begging me to
take her out. Perhaps as I see it now she felt the madness
coming on her, but trade was so promising that I
hung on. After a while the natives told me about
Mr. Millicent, but none of them knew his name, only
that he had come from up country, and there were
queer stories about him. I started tracing the thing
back till I found a priest who told me that an Englishman
like him had robbed a temple up in the Mong
Hills. Then I sold my stuff and started for Rangoon.
There was more of the story there, and I got Mr.
Millicent’s address from a clerk in the shipping office.
I took the first boat to England, came to Bamberley,
and my wife didn’t know me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stopped abruptly, and Derrick made a sudden
gesture of sympathy. Blunt’s face did not alter a
fraction. This was but a tale to him, and apparently
not of great interest, a minor scene in the play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on!” he said again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looking back at it now, I can see one reason for
some of it. Soon after we married she had a son, but
he didn’t live only a few days. She was never quite
the same afterward, knowing she couldn’t have another.
Maybe that had a little to do with her going
off after Mr. Millicent. You can’t guess what it’s
like to be hunting a wife who has gone in pursuit of a
man you never saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Derrick slowly, “I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, that was my case, and when finally I
found her I learned the truth. It wasn’t Mr. Millicent
himself at all, but that damned jade god he had stolen,
that and perhaps the jungle madness. Maybe Blunt
here will tell you more about the thing. Mind you,
the natives believed in it, and whatever it was that got
into her blood made her believe in it, too. At any
rate, Mr. Millicent had the ungodly thing, though I
suppose he never knew just why he stole it, and that
anchored her wherever he happened to be, like a moth
trying to get inside a lamp. She couldn’t get away
if she wanted to. Mr. Millicent himself never knew,
I believe that, and was always kind to her as he was
to every one else, and nothing more. Had I thought
there was anything else I would have killed him myself,
and I don’t care if the sergeant hears me say so,
either. So my wife went into his family as a servant,
just to be near him. Mad, yes, she was mad enough.
Did you never notice her eyes, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we all noticed them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I needn’t say much more about that. As
I say, I got to Beech Lodge, and she looked straight
in my face and didn’t know me for her husband. She
knew that she had known me before, but that was all,
if you understand. I couldn’t force myself on her
without destroying what little comfort she got out of
being near her master, though God knows that was
more pain than comfort. At the same time, I couldn’t
leave her without some kind of protection, for I had
never wanted any woman but her, so I applied for the
job of gardener, and got it, perhaps because I knew
the country Mr. Millicent was thinking of most of the
time. There I was, working for the same people as
my own wife, but no more a husband of my wife’s
than one of my own shrubs. The jade god had her for
its own, and it had Mr. Millicent, too. The fear was
on him. I could see that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you tell Mr. Millicent the truth as
soon as you got to Beech Lodge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because my wife would have gone clean mad if
I had, for he would have tried to send her away. And
back of all this I knew there were those in the Mong
Hills who would never rest or be content till they
got the damned thing back in their own hands.
What’s more, they weren’t the sort who cared much
what they did to get it. Millicent’s life wouldn’t be
worth a snap of the finger when they found out where
he was, if they thought he had it. That was always
in my head. And there was she, moving further and
further away from me, and more and more in love
with him. Can you see the sort of life I led? But
the master was always straight with me, and no man
ever had a better boss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night you applied to me for a job,” put in
Derrick, “I asked her if she thought under all the circumstances
I would do well to take you on, and she
said yes, if I wanted a garden like Mr. Millicent’s.
How do you explain that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simple enough, sir. She remembered me as a
gardener for Mr. Millicent, and that I was good with
flowers, and nothing else.” He broke off in distress
and sent Blunt a pathetic glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You people are getting the truth,” said the latter,
fingering his handcuffs. “Go on, Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I waited and waited, knowing that that lot
in the Mong Hills would never forget, or give the
thing up, and the jade god was working somewhere
in the dark. Then came the night when it happened.
I was out behind the cottage when my wife came
tearing down the drive like a crazy woman, screaming
that she had had a terrible dream and Mr. Millicent
was dead. She was only half dressed, with her hair
down, and just for a minute I thought the worst
of them both, then saw that she was in a sort of daze
as she used to be when once or twice I caught her
walking in her sleep. The knife was in her hand. I
guessed what had happened and got it away from her,
and wiped the blood from her fingers, and all the time
she kept on talking as though she didn’t see me. I
told her it was only a dream and went up to the house
with her and found it was as she said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s voice faltered here, and he looked beseechingly
at Derrick. “What would you have done, sir,
if you’d been me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think probably exactly the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, because no man could do anything else. Here
was this poor woman who did not know she had committed
any crime, only that she had found the man she
loved better than anything on earth in a pool of his
own blood. I knew that I had to act quickly if I was
going to save her and got it into her head that she must
break the news to Mrs. Millicent, who would send her
straight to the cottage again. Her mind was still
dazed, but she grasped that, and I sneaked back to my
own place. And all this I’ve told you is God’s truth,
and it brings you up to the start of what every one
knows about the Millicent mystery. Since then I’ve
kept my mouth shut, but”—and here the man stared
grimly at Burke—“I’d do the same thing again for the
same reason. I know I’m a perjurer and reckon I’ll
have to pay for that. But I’m ready to pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick turned involuntarily to Burke, who had been
sitting quite motionless, slowly twisting a pencil between
his broad finger-tips. The big, strong face reflected
nothing of his thoughts. The sergeant had
drunk in every word, his brain turned to detect any
seeming flaw on which he might fasten. But so far
there was none, except that his stolid British mind
could not grasp the seeming potentiality that lay in a
lump of carved stone. Blunt did not stir a muscle
and regarded his handcuffs with a sort of quiet interest
as though they were children’s toys. From his expression
Derrick knew what Blunt was thinking about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anything else, Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only the inquest and all that part of it. After
it was over I knew by my wife’s face that her soul
had gone wandering after Millicent and that I was
nothing to her and never could be. But she was my
woman, and nothing would alter that. I did not know
where the image was, nor did she, and right away it
seemed clear that if I stayed I might let out something.
I told her I was going away, and she looked at me as
though she had never seen me before, so I knew that
nothing would drive her from Beech Lodge while that
damned thing was hidden there. She wanted to find
it, too, but in a way was afraid to find it. So I hid
the knife and went off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why hide the knife?” put in Derrick sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So in case she should ever be charged with the
murder I might come back and the thing be found
with me. That would let her out,” said Martin
steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick caught his breath. He had a blinding
glimpse of the unswerving devotion hidden behind
this formidable exterior. The sheer depth of it seemed
to dwarf all other kinds of worship. The gallows to
save this cold and repellent woman, this one woman
of his heart. That was the offering Martin stood
ready to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” continued the heavy voice, “I went back
to Burma, and by that time the story of the theft of
the god was pretty much all over the Mong Hills, not
talked of openly, but going round in whispers, and I
knew that something else was bound to happen. I
met Blunt there, and he knew that I knew and followed
me. He’ll tell you his own story about that if you
ask him. I stayed with my sister in America, but
all the time something was calling me back here, so
I came, hotfoot. And the minute I reached the house
I knew the god was still there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when you arrived you found you were no
more to your wife than before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin pulled himself together. “That’s it,” he
said, with a glance almost of gratitude; “not even as
much. And when Miss Millicent came in I knew the
infernal thing was at work again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I felt something of the kind, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin nodded. “I saw that, sir, though you were
all in the dark. Then Blunt got here, as I knew he
would, and you can guess the rest. Last night, when
my woman came into the study and saw things just
as they once were, she thought she had waked up
again, and I hadn’t time to stop her. My God, Mr.
Derrick, did you know what was coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Martin, I didn’t, except that I frankly expected
you might say something. It was a jump in the
dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if I had said what she did, or something
like it, she would be alive now,” groaned the man
bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick could not answer that, and there ensued a
poignant moment which he ended by turning suddenly
to Burke. “Is there anything you want cleared up,
sergeant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir”—the man’s voice was softer than usual—“but
there’s one thing, about Martin calling himself
a perjurer. The law does not ask that a man or
woman give evidence against each other if they are man
and wife. Considering what we’ve heard, I think
Martin can forget the perjury part of it. I see now
how the knife happened to be in the cottage, for that
did surprise me. I thought perhaps Blunt had put it
there for his own purpose. We might as well get on
to what he has to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give you the rest of it,” began the peddler in
a clear voice, “and you can pick any holes in it you
like. All that Martin says is true, every word of it.
I come from the Mong Hills and was born near there.
My father was English, and you might know his
name, but he’s dead now, so that end of it doesn’t
matter. My mother was a Malay woman, and she’s
alive. I lived near a temple in the hills where the
priests believed in what they said and read, which
isn’t always the case in that country. It was a famous
temple, and the more famous on account of what was
in it, this being a lot of images of Buddha, all the work
of one man. The name of the man was Lung Sen, and
he had the blood of forefathers who were the greatest
artists of their time in wood and gold and jade. Most
of Lung’s work went to this temple, where it was very
precious, but of the man himself the priests knew nothing
except that the faces he carved were alive and something
moved behind the eyes. One night I stayed with
Lung, and before morning came I knew the man as
none other ever had. It seemed that there were two
men in him, one the carver of images, the other with
all the evil of the world wrapped up in his black heart.
He told me, perhaps because I had foreign blood and
he thought I would understand better, that he was
tired of making flat-faced Buddhas and had been tired
for years, and that evil was more interesting than good,
and it was more difficult to carve evil than the other
thing. Then he looked at me for a quarter of an hour
while he smoked, and took something out of a roll of
silk. It was the jade god.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused reflectively, his eyes cloudy with memories,
and Derrick had a glimpse of what he must have
seen then. The half-light, the dark sardonic face, the
long, lean fingers, the obscurity of a riverside hut, and
all around it the ceaseless whisper of the jungle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I saw that,” went on Blunt presently, “I
was frightened, for it was the image of the soul that
Lung Sen had hidden from the world. He had spent
years making it, putting in the hours when he wasn’t
turning out the standard article. And as he looked at
the thing I saw that his own face had become just like
it. There was a sort of living devil there, crammed
with all the knowledge in hell and afraid of nothing
in the other place. And this was the man who had
been carving Buddhas for nearly fifty years according
to his own account. I asked him what he was going
to do with it, and he said put it in the temple, where
they let him do pretty much as he liked, and after a
while it would acquire and soak in the power of the
real thing, by which it would be surrounded, but would
lose nothing of what he had carved on it. That would
make it a god of evil, with the influence of the real
gods behind it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man hesitated an instant and looked curiously
at Derrick. “All this may sound like a fairy-story
to you, but if you and your people had lived in the
Mong Hills all your lives it wouldn’t seem like
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, when he finished it, working with sharp
sand and thousands of little wooden drills to cut
the stone, he did put it in the temple. I don’t know
how long the job had taken, but probably not less
than thirty years. Then he sat tight, smiling to himself,
till the priests found out. They knew in a minute
that if the thing ever got away from them it would
raise hell for whoever had it, so they guarded it day
and night till a year or so later Millicent came along.
He heard of it; the thought of the thing began to
work in his brain; and, to make a long story short,
he bribed a young priest and got away with it. The
first thing that happened was that Lung Sen didn’t
wake up one morning, and his face was just like the
jade god’s. The priest was never seen again. Then
for some reason they sent for me and told me to go
in search of it; didn’t ask, but told me. And I knew
enough to go. It took me years to find Martin, and
if you ask why I didn’t give it up long ago, I can’t
tell you, except that I knew another was coming after
me, and then another, but I would only see them
once. When I got here, I knew by Martin’s face that
the god was not far off. So now”—here he glanced
dominantly at Derrick—“this thing must go back with
me. The god of all evil lives in it, and whoever keeps
it will be cursed. Joy will die for him, and fear will
come, and love be changed to a dream of terror. God
hides in that stone, and sacrifices must be made in
front of it. What becomes of me does not matter.
The woman killed the man, because the image commanded
her. She could not help it, her love being
turned to gall. And this is only the beginning of what
must come if the image stays in your keeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice lifted with a strange domination that
brooked no interruption, and the peddler’s features
took on a look of exalted prophecy. “What do the
children of to-day know of the wisdom that dwelt in
the hills of Mong when England was peopled by half-naked
savages? They are like children with toys they
do not understand. Gautama opened the books of
good and evil that all might read. You of the West
have read not at all; Lung Sen read only the evil, and
he is dead; and this man from an English village disobeyed
the law and passed at the hand of one who
struck when her eyes were closed. When after two
years they opened, she struck again, but this time at
herself. She was asleep, but the god never sleeps.
So if you do not give it to me, then make an end
of me quickly, and prepare for the next messenger,
who is now on his way, and will not ask, but
take.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence descended in the cell. Burke’s eyes were
half closed, as though he peered at visions hitherto
unguessed. A cart creaked in the distance but did
not break the spell. Derrick had an abiding sensation
that from the East a hand had reached out and
touched the village of Bamberley into a strange sleep.
Martin sat motionless, reliving the past, while the
peddler clasped his lean fingers, a look of intense
abstraction on his dark smooth face. Derrick was
aware that he felt amazingly impotent, and with difficulty
made an indefinite gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sergeant,” he said, after a long pause, “I make
no charge against Martin and will go bail for his appearance
at the inquest when wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man jerked himself together, stood up,
groped in his pocket, and produced a key. There was
a click of steel. Martin was a free man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might go back to the cottage now,” said
Derrick, looking him full in the eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gardener nodded, shook himself like a wet dog,
said one sibilant word of farewell to the peddler, and
vanished. His step was still audible when Burke
fastened an inquiring look on Blunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about this man, sir? Are you going to let
him down as easy as that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take it that the only charge is of attempted
theft?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right, but I wouldn’t be so sure about bail
in this case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the only damage is to the French window?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s for you to say, sir. It’s your house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick turned to Blunt. “You have come here in
search of a certain thing. In that I believe you have
told the truth, but as to what may follow if you
don’t get it, that’s another story. I do accept what
you said about the image, and that it has for some
reason an evil effect. It is not necessary to go into
that any further, but since the thing is evil, it should
no longer exist, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blunt leaped to his feet. “What are you going
to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First leave it to the sergeant to decide whether he
keeps you here till the inquest, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll certainly do that,” put in Burke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, after that’s over there will be no reason for
you to stay in England any longer. You can go back
to the Mong Hills and tell them that the image does
not exist. It won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll destroy it?” whispered Blunt, aghast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. If it’s the evil thing you say, and I believe
you, it ought to be destroyed. If it isn’t, you’ve been
lying, which I don’t believe. I’ve learned something
from all this, Blunt,” he added thoughtfully, “and my
mind is made up. Good morning, sergeant.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch12'>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>“I LOVE YOU!”</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>D</span>ERRICK got back to Beech Lodge in time
for lunch and plunged at once into a vastly
different atmosphere. The house was servantless,
and this very fact had kept Edith too busy
to indulge in any morbid reflections, even had her
resilient nature felt so inclined. She was moved by
the knowledge that her brother had been under a
strain which, however incomprehensible to herself,
was nevertheless to him very real. It was reflected in
his eyes, his restless manner, and the notes that had
lain untouched for weeks. She wanted him to get
back to his work, to be normal, and above all things
happy. She recognized and admired the creative side
of him, made allowances for what she considered the
essential vagaries of his temperament, and had long
since decided to sacrifice herself if necessary on so
unusual an altar. She could feel for him, if not with
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, returning from the grim scene of Bamberley
jail, he found an energetic, practical young person,
obviously full of work, and over whom hung but
little of the tragedy of the immediate past. She
supplied the touch that the moment demanded. He
welcomed this, leaned on it far more than he realized,
and sat down at the table with a feeling of prodigious
relief. The hand of the domestic artist was visible
here, and if at times the diaphanous shape of the
stiff figure of Perkins seemed to stand close to his
shoulder, the sensation did not oppress him. Edith
talked generalities till, nearly at the end of the meal,
she sent him a frank questioning look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I’m just dying to know if anything new
came out this morning. Martin turned up an hour
ago. He seemed to me like another man, got out his
tools and went to work without a word, and it made
me more curious than ever. That queer puzzling expression
has gone out of his eyes, and I couldn’t help
thinking he was something like a dog that had been
stolen and found his way back to his old home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick nodded cheerfully. “I rather fancy he
feels like that, just for the present, anyway, but we’ll
probably have to find another gardener. He won’t
want to stay here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I suppose he couldn’t.” She hesitated a
moment, then gave him the straightforward glance
he knew so well. “Do you know, Jack, I think we’ve
all been rather stupid about that poor woman; yes,
I mean you, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s quite possible,” he admitted, “but why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose it’s easy to put things together,
afterward; but, looking back at everything, what
happened seems in a way as natural as it was dreadful.
The poor soul had her terrible secret and took the only
way out of it, but couldn’t we have anticipated that
somehow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the last thing one could imagine.” He
went on, and told her some of what had transpired
that morning in Bamberley jail, but not all. She
listened silently, with little gestures of wonder, and
a softened light in her honest, brown eyes. At the
story of Martin’s devotion they filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One has heard of men like that with one great
passion in their lives that no one else can understand
because there seems nothing to bring it to life. Perhaps
women are apt to be hard on women, but it’s
hard to see how Perkins could have roused such a
thing. After all, it may be the men who are queer,
and not us. I suppose this story will be all over
England in a few days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made a grimace. “I’m afraid so. The reporters
will gather like a flock of crows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But after that’s over will you be able to settle
down to work, and—and the other thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What other thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you go to see the Millicents?” she asked
cheerfully. “It’s all a frightful mixture, I know, and
it seems rather appalling that you two should have been
brought together like this, but perhaps stranger things
have happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much stranger,” he said thoughtfully. “I’m
going there in an hour or so. They’re expecting
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she went on with growing earnestness,
“I know it’s your affair, but I wouldn’t say a word
more than necessary. The thing is done with, Jack,
all except this horrid inquest, at which you say Jean
and I won’t have to appear, and you don’t know how
glad I am of that. I’ve a feeling that you’ll have a
good many years in which to tell her the rest of it—I
mean anything more you think she should know—but
don’t burden her with what is so grim, if you
can help it. She’s too young. Girls like her often
seem to offer themselves unconsciously to wounds,
but they don’t find out till afterward how deep the
thing has gone. As for Mrs. Millicent, I wouldn’t
attempt to say much to her. Let Jean do that in her
own way. Nothing can be as close as mother and
daughter in a time like this, and they can’t hurt each
other. You’ll probably think me dreadfully cheeky,
but I rather feel that you and Jean have been dwelling
mentally far too long on things you both think I can’t
understand because I’m not occult, but I do understand
them just enough to feel that they’re neither
cheerful nor in a queer way healthy for people of your
age. So please forgive all this, and give me a cigarette,
and help clear this table, and for goodness’ sake
tell me where I can get a cook and housemaid who
won’t imagine Beech Lodge is full of horrors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed outright, the first real laugh for weeks.
“You’ve got my future pretty well mapped out, but
I think you’re right about the Millicents. Been in
the study this morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and the room is just as it was when we came
here. But that desk was a fearful weight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You moved it yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, seeing there was no one else, and all
the time I had an odd feeling that the things were
glad to be moved back. Is that sort of feeling accounted
for in your philosophy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is now, thanks to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been wondering what you’re going to do with
that jade image. I couldn’t find the panel this
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But have you the right? It isn’t yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll chance that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Jack, if it was included in the inventory you
can’t destroy it without all kinds of dilapidations to
the Thursbys. Isn’t it supposed to be valuable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be, but most decidedly it was not in the
inventory, therefore it was not sold to the Thursbys,
and consequently I needn’t answer to them, but only
to the Millicents. And I fancy I know what they’ll
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you ought to by this time, and, speaking of
the Thursbys, I’ve an idea that if everything that has
taken place since we came had happened eighteen
months ago they wouldn’t have let this house when
you came along and fell in love with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they weren’t in it then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but they would have been; at least, something
suggests they would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you say that?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because she’s not the kind of woman to be afraid
of anything obvious, anything she can see and even
partly understand. If poor Perkins had done away
with herself then, I rather think Mrs. Thursby would
have been as much fascinated as horrified. Don’t you
know that sort? It would have given her something
to talk about for the rest of her life with no one to
interrupt; something infinitely more intriguing than
her husband’s grenades, or whatever they are. How
do you feel yourself about that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not quite sure,” he said candidly. “What
I did feel about the house until yesterday seems to
have gone this morning, as though a wind had blown
through it with all the windows open. But I wouldn’t
mind subletting now, if there were any chance of it,
which there isn’t at this time of year. So we have
it for another nine months anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t very well bring Jean back here,”
she murmured thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “No, I couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith got up with the sudden remembrance that
her hands were very full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose there’s time enough for that, and
anyway you have to marry her first. Wouldn’t it be
queer if—” She broke off with a little laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, I’m only wandering, and of course just
when there’s no time for it. Please put these things
on that tray and open the pantry door. I won’t
expect you for tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went off a little later, passing Martin, who only
touched his cap. He did look like another man, but
neither of them spoke. The shadow of despair seemed
to have left his face and to be replaced by a gravity
that was new and dignified. Derrick strode on with
the consciousness that the wind had blown through
himself as well as Beech Lodge. He admitted his
debt to Edith and now saw her cheerful sanity in a
fresh light. It was strange to have leaned on a
person, however dear, because they were incapable
of being torn by one’s own reactions. How bright
she was! How helpful and practical! What a standby!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he never knew what the past hour or two had
cost her—she was too good an actor for that; nor did
he guess that she had watched him to the gate, her
eyes dim, feeling more lonely than ever before in her
life. She admitted there was much she did not understand,
or even want to understand, but he did not
perceive how often she had come nearly to the breaking-point.
With Edith it was as with many another
woman, the cost of whose sacrifice is hidden too deep
for discovery, and only the beauty of it revealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean and her mother were together, and Mrs. Millicent
greeted him with a quiet affection that
touched him deeply. It meant that not only had Jean
told her of the tragedy of the night before but also that
she saw in him more than the man who had solved
the mystery of her husband’s death. Jean’s eyes met
his own as she gave him her hand, and they carried a
message that needed no speech. Mrs. Millicent regarded
them both with a gentle pleasure in which there
was no surprise, then waited a little nervously. The
picture of the study of Beech Lodge and what had
happened there still haunted her brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jean told me you were to have a talk with Martin
and the peddler this morning,” she said. “Did you
see them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did they tell you anything new about my—my
husband?” She had summoned all her courage for
this question and wanted it over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick shook his head. “There was very little
about that and nothing of real importance. It was
mostly about the image he found in Burma which
Blunt says has a good deal of past history that makes
it of special interest to certain people there. Both
men agreed that it carried bad luck, and sometimes
danger, wherever it went. It’s quite obvious that in
some way it fascinated Mr. Millicent; and”—here he
hesitated an instant—“it seems to have exercised later
on the same influence over Perkins; and,” he concluded
slowly, “the thing worked in her brain till finally she
did what she did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Millicent shivered. “I know it impressed him
tremendously. That was clear from the day he got
back from Burma. He once told me he thought it
was valuable, but it always frightened me because of
its effect on him. It seemed to carry some dreadful
secret with it. I asked him to destroy it several
times, but that rather shocked him. He never let it
out of his own hands and always hid it where you
found it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you feel that way about it now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, more than ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then may I destroy it?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be very glad and feel happier than in a
long time if you did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, and I think others may be happier, too, in
the long run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded. “Isn’t it strange?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes rested a moment on Jean’s lovely face,
then turned back to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy,” she said with a sort of soft impulsiveness,
“do you think I can’t see how it is between you
two? The strange part is that the last three months
should have resulted in this, that out of shadows and
uncertainty should come something so different. I’m
afraid I have not understood much of all you’ve done
at Beech Lodge, but I remember so distinctly the day
when Jean said she must go in and tell you what had
happened there. I can’t say anything more about it
now, for I’m too conscious of the effect of it all on this
child of mine, but soon you and I must have a long
talk. How is your sister?” she added unsteadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I think. Her hands are rather full now
till she gets some help.” He knew that Jean’s eyes
were fixed on him and found it hard to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure of that. She’s splendid, and something
tells me we’re going to be great friends. You’ll stay
for tea, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that she got up, put her hand on his shoulder
for an understanding instant, and went out. She felt
as though a new grasp, young and strong, had laid
hold of the wheel of life, and was comforted. They
heard her step on the stair. Derrick, his breath coming
faster, crossed the room, stood for a moment
beside Jean’s chair, and put out his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you,” he whispered; “I love you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed at him, her cheeks pale, then flooding
with an exquisite color, and came to him with a quick
little sigh of happiness. It was not thus they had
clung together the evening before. Now there was
joy in the clinging, and the sweet promise of more joy
that awaited them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember that first morning we met?”
he whispered again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know why I went to Beech Lodge. I
think I had to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that was it. I thought you were so wonderful
and brave. The house was never quite the same after
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think I was wise to come?” she smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered with a kiss, and she stirred in his arms,
only to be drawn closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was tremendously interested in you, even then,”
she confided, “and rather frightened. I hope I didn’t
show it. Did Edith think I was very bold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edith thinks no end of you. She’s a trump.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean nodded happily. “You and I need some one
like that near us, Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want any one near us for a while,” he protested.
“How did your mother know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid she must have gathered something
from me. Does Edith know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I began to think she knew as soon as I did, if
not before. She’s awfully pleased about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl was silent for a moment. “Jack, dearest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there much you didn’t tell mother; I mean about
this morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried just to say what would help her. The
rest can keep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there was nothing that could make any difference
to—to us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was something I always felt, but I couldn’t
make myself tell you. It was the sensation that whatever
had descended on father would also involve me
in the same way. I can’t really explain beyond that,
but it meant that I couldn’t surrender and let myself
love you till all this had been lifted away. Last night,
when I saw what happened, and in spite of the dreadfulness
of it, the strangest feeling came that it had
been lifted in that moment. When you were trying
to help Perkins, I couldn’t avoid staring at the jade
god, because I knew he had something to do with it.
He stared back, and for the very first time I was not
afraid of him. It was just as though Perkins had
paid for everything and set me free. Tell me that
nothing was said this morning by either of those men
to upset that; but you must tell me on your honor.”
She shivered involuntarily, but gradually her tremor
ceased under his nearness and strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that was said, and I’ll tell you all of it some
day, points to the same thing. There is absolutely
nothing to fear. We’ll prove that very soon, you and
I, and there will be no longer a jade god to work mischief.
Don’t you realize, darling, those days are all
past?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her arms tightened round his neck. “Why do you
love me, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been waiting for you all my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, slowly, she raised her lips to his.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch13'>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE SACRIFICE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HREE DAYS later Mrs. Millicent and Jean
turned in at the gate of Beech Lodge. It
was the first time in more than two years
they had been there together. Half-way up the drive
they were met by Edith, who came out anxious to
do what she could to help in what she knew was a
trying moment. She kissed Jean affectionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad to see you both. You’ll find the
house at loose ends, for it isn’t actually running, but
just moving, so please forgive that. Our temporary
servants are very temporary, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Millicent nodded. She had dreaded the visit
and somehow felt more at peace than she had expected.
But her heart sank a little when she entered the
house. In the hall she looked mutely about and
hesitated as Edith led the way to the study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack doesn’t know you’re here yet,” said the
latter cheerfully. “I’m rather pleased with him to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” smiled Jean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s actually got to work again, more like the
old Jack than for months. I hope you’ll keep him at
it when your turn comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She opened the door as she spoke. Derrick, who
was behind a litter of manuscript, jumped up, thrilled
at the sight of his visitor. Mrs. Millicent’s eyes swept
the familiar room, fighting lest she see what she feared
to see. She noted that the big desk was now covered
with baize, the rugs differently arranged, the prints
rehung, and a flower-box in the window. Photographs
were on the table, another lamp on the desk,
new ornaments on the narrow shelf above the dark
wainscoting. She recognized the thought that lay
behind all this, and it touched her deeply. Then her
glance was drawn to the portrait, and she sat down,
overcome for the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please don’t mind me,” she said valiantly. “I’ll
be all right in a second, and it’s quite right I should
come here first.” She looked gratefully at Edith,
“I’ll be able to say ‘Thank you’ presently. Somehow
you’ve made the room seem ever so much bigger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith filled the gap of her brother’s silence. His
eyes were dwelling on Jean’s lovely face, with its
smooth oval and the delicate lips. Her throat was
very white and perfectly molded, while neck and
shoulder joined in a lissom curve he found amazingly
attractive. There was strength in the slim straightness
of her body, and grace in every gesture; but her
chief allure lay in her eyes. These, full of changing
light, seemed like calm, deep pools in the shadows of
her dark brows, reflecting mood and thought with a
sweet and rare fidelity. They held a soft luster all
their own. For an instant Derrick stood quite motionless,
a little blinded by it all. Then he heard Edith’s
voice and responded to a note in it that was meant
for him, though she spoke to Mrs. Millicent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought perhaps you’d sooner come in here at
once, and it won’t be so hard the next time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Millicent nodded, but her lips were trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been very much bothered by strangers?”
asked Jean quickly. “I’ve seen so many in the
village, and most of them seemed on their way out
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was appalling till yesterday; then Sergeant
Burke put a man on the gate, and that stopped it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Martin?” asked Mrs. Millicent. She
had looked for him among the rose-trees and been
relieved not to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He left yesterday,” said Derrick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did he go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t say. In fact, I didn’t even see him, or
know he was going. I noticed that he wasn’t in the
garden at noon, and the tool-shed was closed; so I
went to the cottage and found a note addressed to myself.
It was rather pathetic. He just wrote that
since there was nothing to keep him here now, he was
going back. He didn’t say where, but it was probably
to the Orient. There was a month’s wages
due to him to-day, and he didn’t want them. Then
he thanked me for treating him decently, said he was
glad I was going to do what I told Blunt I proposed
to do, and that was all, except a postscript about the
Lady Hillingdons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Martin!” said Jean under her breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that other man?” added her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will be free to-morrow, and he also will go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Burma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so. He’s being detained till then on a
technical charge only. He looks different now,
with none of his former spring and activity. That’s
because he knows what is going to be done. He seems
dazed, and in a queer way almost horrified, as though
it were sacrilege. It was the same way with him at
the inquest, which was very short, considering everything.
Burke, on the other hand, is like another man
and bursting with importance. He expects to be regarded
as an authority on unusual cases, and probably
will be. There’s a great demand for his photograph
already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did the inquest result in?” she asked
timidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only that the poor woman died at her own hands
while under temporary insanity. There could be no
other conclusion. Martin was not charged with anything
before, so there was really nothing he needed
to be cleared of. His evidence, as well as that of
Blunt, was taken and accepted, and a statement will
most likely be issued about what took place here two
years ago. Martin was afraid he would be prosecuted
for perjury, but the fact that it was his own wife
gets him free of that. So really the matter is closed
now, and it’s just a case of living down what is
always bound to continue for a little while after a
thing of this sort. If I were you I wouldn’t read the
papers for a few days, and then it will be replaced by
something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off, pitched his mind as far as possible
from the subject, then remembered that there was one
duty still to perform to close the affair for all time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a note from Mrs. Thursby this morning,”
said Edith musingly. “She wrote that they would be
passing this afternoon, and might they come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean looked up. “She must be tremendously curious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect so. She’s rather that sort of woman.
I haven’t seen them for about three months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Millicent smiled a little. “She’s a great believer
in the power of money and even thought I’d
sell my husband’s portrait, to which she took a great
fancy. I couldn’t have it with me, as there’s no room
for a big picture in our cottage. There are some more
things up-stairs, too, that are ours; but I sold everything
else in this room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick shot a swift inquiring glance at Jean and
made a slight gesture toward the mantel. She looked
puzzled for a minute, then nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t sell this, Mrs. Millicent?” He touched
the panel, and the jade god gleamed from its wooden
prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her hand to her breast. “So that is where
it was kept! I never knew till Jean told me. No, I
didn’t sell it. I never thought of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s hard to say just what it suggests to me now,”
he began slowly, “and still more what it may really
mean to a man like Blunt. It’s one of those things to
which there’s no straight answer. But if there had
been no jade god here”—he paused, then added with a
brilliant smile—“I wouldn’t have found Jean. Edith
doesn’t believe in all this, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t say that,” interrupted his sister, “but
just that I didn’t understand, and”—she shook her
head decisively—“I didn’t want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you were the most right,” he chuckled,
“when you suggested that the thing wasn’t somehow
healthy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I did, I stick to it. It’s beastly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Millicent put out a hand as though to touch it,
but withdrew at the stare of the tiny basilisk eyes. It
seemed to her that this fragment of carved stone,
glimmering opaquely as the rays of the level sun filtered
through it, still threatened her, and she felt grateful
for the steadiness of the hand that held it. Youth
was about to dissipate the nightmare of the past. But
somehow she did not want to see the thing done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” she said, with a glance at Edith, “that
you and I might let these two perform the ceremony
by themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith laughed and nodded. “Jack will certainly
smash the end of a finger before it’s over, and I can
see by his face that he’s in tune for a regular oblation.
It’s that sacrificial look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick grinned cheerfully but did not speak.
When they were alone he put the image on the mantel
and took his girl in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s years since I saw you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled back, her face very close to his.
“Dearest, it’s only three days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is three too many. What an inspiration of
your mother’s! Do you know what smashing that
thing will be like with you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like gathering up all that is dark and ominous
and deadly in the world, and obliterating it in front
of everything that is sweet and lovely and desirable.
You never knew that the first one to go was the one
who made it, and then fear of it began to spread. I’ll
tell you about it some day—the whole story. But
now it’s all ended and done with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where will you break it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stole a glance at Millicent’s portrait. “Here,
on the hearth, under that. I think he’ll know about
it and be glad. It won’t burn, but I’ve got a wax
duplicate that ought to make a pillar of flame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opening a drawer in the desk, he took out a hammer
and the model, then laid the image on the tile hearth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is proof, at any rate for you and me,” he
said thoughtfully, “that this exercised a strange influence
over the minds of many persons. It is the object
of fear among thousands we shall never see, and
the story of it has run through valleys and hills on the
other side of the earth where the brown people talk of
it in whispers. It has brought men round the world,
and there are others who are waiting for the word
that will bring them, too. Just so long as it exists
there will be pain and theft and crime and fear. And
this is the finish of all that, darling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised the hammer. Driven with all the strength
of his wrist, it fell fair on the malignant head. There
was a shivering sound as of tinkling glass, and the jade
god dissolved into mottled green fragments. He felt
a sharp pang in his thumb. An emerald splinter
quivered there, like a miniature javelin beaded with
blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evil to the very end,” he grunted, then struck
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The god’s head dwindled to powder. He swept
back the wreckage and dropped the wax model into the
smoldering embers. Flame shot up, leaping, sputtering,
and hissing. They stood staring at it, their cheeks
touching. It was in Derrick’s mind that in this flame
the dross of life was being burned away. Jean did not
move till the fiery pyramid subsided. And as it died
there came the sound of a horn from the drive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Thursbys,” he said disgustedly. “Do you
want to see them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, no. What had I better do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d go to your mother, and please ask Edith to
join me here.” He gave a sudden little smile. “I’ve
a sort of foolish idea that—” He stopped, glanced
at the hearth, and shook his head. “No, it’s too
foolish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait till Thursby has gone. Kiss me quickly
instead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She vanished, her cheeks glowing. A moment later
Edith came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, our friends are here, but why couldn’t they
be content with what’s in the papers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no time to answer, for the Thursbys were
already in the hall. Mrs. Thursby swept in like a
fresh breeze, followed by her husband. Derrick
thought the latter looked a little sheepish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said the stout woman explosively to
Edith, “what a perfectly awful time you must have
had! We were over in France when we read of it, and
even now when I think of that woman Perkins it gives
me the shivers. I’ve blamed myself so much for not
telling your brother everything the first time he came
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Matter of fact,” chimed in Thursby, with a sidelong
glance at the portrait, “I didn’t say anything because
it didn’t seem necessary. I reckoned that ignorance
was bliss so far as you were concerned, and we’d had
rather a dose of it ourselves. The agents thought so,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it was,” said Derrick dryly, “and there’s
no real harm done. The thing is finally cleared up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I said before, I could never understand that
woman,” went on Mrs. Thursby, “but of course I do
now. She must have been disappointed in love early
in life, and married Martin to get even with some one
else. Women often do that and pay for it afterward.
But fancy living with her as we both did! Fancy a
mad housemaid at your bedside saying the tea is ready,
and thinking, perhaps, about killing one all the time.
I wonder what sent her mad, Mr. Derrick. Didn’t
you hear that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was insanity in her family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had she been like that for long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good many years, it seems.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Thursby took a deep breath. “Well, that was
the only thing the matter with Beech Lodge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” asked Edith curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A crazy housemaid. I felt that as soon as we left
the place. Of course,” she continued reflectively,
“you’ll think I must have been a bit crazy myself for
not discharging her. I did make up my mind to that
a good many times, but when it came to looking her
in the face and saying she wouldn’t be wanted any
more, I—well, I just couldn’t. Silly, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can almost understand that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad you can. I couldn’t. Was she nice to
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was a wonderful servant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see she liked you, but gave me the
creeps. And the funny thing was that I couldn’t
imagine the house without her, though it seems perfectly
natural now, and this room is ever so much
brighter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thursby nodded. “It’s rather a pity you couldn’t
imagine it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stout woman laughed. “James has never quite
forgiven me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For what?” asked Derrick. His eyes were keen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For letting the place at all. We took another,
stayed in it a month, then gave that up, and have
been living in hotels ever since. I hate living in my
trunks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t happen to be in the market for Beech
Lodge, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sent him a swift look of intelligence. “Whatever
made you think of that? Are we, James? If I
do the letting, you generally do the renting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Light began to dawn on the Derricks, and Edith
made a cautious little signal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brother is only joking, of course. The idea
is too funny. We’ve just had all the expense and
trouble of moving in, and it’s foolish to dream of anything
but staying here. Don’t mind what he says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thursby pushed out his lips. “Oh, I don’t know
that it’s so foolish. If circumstances, I mean business
ones, are satisfactory, nothing is foolish. I learned
long ago that when my wife gets a premonition that
we’re going to do something, we most always do.
For instance,” he blurted, “if she were to say she had
a feeling we were going to move back to Beech Lodge
I’d bet on it. It’s safe money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick laughed. “Aren’t you reckoning a little
without your host?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it sounds like that. I say, I wonder what
Mrs. Millicent thought of all this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She probably thinks it’s a sort of release for that
woman and every one else,” put in his wife hastily;
“and that’s the only way to look at it. A sort of a
general clean-up, I call it. Fancy that gardener coming
back, too. He must have been the only person
in the world who wasn’t frightened of his wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you think you’ll be this summer?” interposed
Edith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Thursby folded her plump hands. “I
shouldn’t be surprised if that depended on you,” she
said calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other woman nodded and went on with a kind
of placid deliberation. “My dear, it’s no earthly use
beating about the bush any longer, and I’m going to
come straight out with it. Very soon after we let this
place to you, we took another, didn’t like it, and then
I knew we’d been too impulsive about letting Beech
Lodge, and I wanted to come back to it, Perkins or no
Perkins. I never gave the dreadful woman a thought,
because she didn’t seem to matter nearly so much
when one had not to look at her. I told my husband
about it, but he only laughed, said I had changed my
mind too late in the day and the idea was absurd.
Later we went over to France for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you there long?” asked Derrick curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, only a few weeks. I couldn’t settle down
somehow. Then we read about what happened here,
and I knew what was the matter with me. It was
just as though that woman had telegraphed me that
she was out of the way now, and I might come back.”
She paused, with an odd expression on her round face,
and glanced approvingly round the room. “So now,
if it is possible to arrange it, I want to come. If
you’re agreeable, then it’s up to your brother and my
husband. So far as I’m concerned, it’s not a matter
of money, and James knows that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned back with a nod which announced that
on this subject she had now emptied her mind, and
there was no chance of misunderstanding it on the
part of her husband. He was the means to the end.
Thursby’s hands were deep in his pockets, and he
stared out over the lawn, his brows puckered, as though
he were adding up figures, which indeed he was.
Edith’s eyes caught those of her brother, and she signaled
a message that left no possibility of doubt in
his mind. At that he turned to Thursby:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we have a stroll? I’ve put in quite a lot of
new roses, and there’ll be something of a show here
next summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little man nodded jerkily, and they went out.
Mrs. Thursby sat up straight and heaved a contented
sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, that’ll be all right, if it suits you. Isn’t it
all queer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think every one feels that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course I don’t know the ins and outs of
it, only what’s in the papers, and I suppose there’s
a lot more, but I felt that neither you nor I had much
to do with that woman staying on here. However,
I’ve my eye on a jewel of a girl now who will go anywhere.
Do you suppose if those men agree there’ll
have to be another inventory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid so, though we haven’t had time yet to
do much damage. That French window was broken,
but it’s been repaired.” She paused, while something
drew her eyes to the hearth. “And there’s that jade
image,” she added uncertainly; “but that’s Mrs. Millicent’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What jade image? I never saw one here. Where
is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s left of it is in the fireplace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stout little woman stooped and picked out an
emerald splinter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, what perfectly lovely stuff! Were you
going to throw it away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Mrs. Millicent’s, and she asked to have the
image destroyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And jade, too! How queer some people are! It’s
very fashionable now, and there’s enough here to
make some gorgeous ear-rings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought of the remodeled god with his cold
fingers at her throat gave Edith an involuntary chill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really don’t want it, and am sure Mrs. Millicent
doesn’t, so please take it if you wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Thursby dropped the splinter into her bag,
got on her knees, and poked about among the ashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid the rest is all dust. What a pity!
I’ve been trying to mesmerize James for years into
buying me something of jade, but he simply won’t.
Now I’m going to give him a surprise, so please
don’t say a thing about it. Here they come now, and
I think it’s all arranged. James is pretty quick in
business matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Thursbys’ car rolled away a few minutes later,
and Derrick darted up-stairs. He found Jean and
her mother in Edith’s room and, linking arms, marched
them cheerily back to the study, where Edith waited
with a patience in which there was no virtue whatever.
Then he put his arm round Jean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thursby,” he said contentedly, “was like clay
in the hands of the potter. I began by reminding
him that not only had we the lease till next winter, but
also the right of extension for another three years on
the same terms. He pretended to have forgotten that,
but of course he hadn’t. Then I hinted that I’d get
into frightful trouble with Edith if I upset all her
plans, and that helped a good deal. It was quite clear
from his manner that he had his orders. I dwelt as
much as I dared on the discomfort of moving and all
that, and the more I said the more anxious he got. He
must have the highest regard for his wife’s wishes.
Anyway, it’s arranged. He makes good the cost of
our moving here, gives five hundred for the cancellation
of the lease, and also meets the cost of our moving
out. And I think that’s about all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How perfectly wonderful!” said Jean. “Aren’t
you glad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad is no word for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack,” put in Edith, “I never knew before you
were such a business man.” She paused and glanced
at him suspiciously. “Just when have you committed
us to that move?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A month from to-day. I thought it over carefully
and decided that ought to suit every one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick’s eyes grew soft. He leaned over to Mrs.
Millicent and took both her hands in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I have Jean a month from to-day?” he said
very gently.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch14'>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A BROKEN TILE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>LMOST exactly four months after he had
completed his second inventory of the contents
of Beech Lodge, Mr. Jarrad, again
accompanied by Mr. Dawkins, stood once more in the
paneled study. He had come to the house with his
admirable manner, in which was blended this time a
rather full knowledge of what had recently happened.
Mr. Dawkins, who also read the papers, and was, as
well, impressed by the air of the older man, seemed
rather taciturn. There had been opportunity to say
a good deal on the way down from London, and he
was distinctly thrilled when they turned in at the white
gate. Now the inventory book was opened and laid
on Millicent’s desk. Mr. Jarrad then took out a large
handkerchief and blew his nose with a trumpet-like
sound as though he enjoyed it. He had ascertained
that the Derricks were in the garden, and both servants
back in the kitchen. The morning was fine and
clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” he said with a touch of unction,
“when I’ve heard of a case just exactly like this.
Here we are, paid to do precisely the same thing over
again simply because a foolish woman killed herself.
We’ve both seen houses that were enough to make
any really sensitive person commit suicide, but”—he
glanced round with open approval—“they were not
houses like this. It all brings back to me the great
truth that the foundation of our business is the undeniable
suspicion that well-bred people have of each
other. There’s practically no inventory connection
with the lower and lower middle classes. Do you
happen to remember a remark I made about ‘things’
when we were here last?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” replied Dawkins; “and, what’s more, I’ve
been thinking about it ever since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, these are not the kind of things to make one
tired of life. There’s another point. I expressed
my conclusions about the manner in which ‘things’
occupy the greater part of the time of so many women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did,” said Dawkins soberly, “and I said it
wasn’t that way with us because we hadn’t any. But
my young woman has started since then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad smiled. “Quite so; that was inevitable;
and now that Mrs. Millicent has disposed of hers to
Mr. Thursby, Miss Millicent, who will marry Mr.
Derrick next week, is already starting another collection.
I hope she may do as well as this. She can’t
do better. I don’t know when I’ve seen a room I
like more. Her mother’s work, of course, all of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you suppose that woman killed Mr.
Millicent?” asked Dawkins thoughtfully. “I read it
all several times over in several papers, but it always
struck me there was a good deal that didn’t meet the
eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad smiled again. “Why, do you suppose,
does a woman do anything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know yet. I’ve only been married a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you know more now than you will in ten.
The appearance of Perkins suggested that she might
do anything at any moment, if you remember. If
the cause was what it usually is with a woman—jealousy,
or, in other words, love that has grown the
wrong way—I can only wonder why she waited so
many years. There are a good many queer things
about the case; for instance, that foreigner who
shammed dead when he was under arrest, then slid out
of the station.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what he was doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might as well ask why Mr. Millicent’s old gardener
came back as though he wanted to stick his head into
the noose,” said Mr. Jarrad sententiously. “Might
as well ask why my client is willing to pay through the
nose to get this house back just after letting it for a
term of years—though I suspect there’s a woman in
that, too. Might as well ask why your client began
by trying to hunt out Mr. Millicent’s murderer and
finished by finding his daughter. Might as well ask
a heap of things that will never be answered, and perhaps
in the long run it’s just as well they’re not. We
know as much as is good for us as it is, and what we
don’t know can’t hurt us much as long as we keep on
not knowing it. Now what about the contents of this
room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The stuff seems the same with a few additions,
but a little differently arranged; that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad strolled about, his sharp eyes very
active, returned to the desk, leaned over, then adjusted
his glasses. He peered for a moment and frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s really very odd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember we didn’t agree about a stain here,
and returned so that I could satisfy you on the point?
It was a little difficult to detect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins wetted his thumb and turned a few leaves
in the big book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, here it is, a post entry, and initialed by both
of us. ‘Large, irregular stain on near left-hand corner
of leather-desk top, nearly effaced.’ Right ho! let’s
have a look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came over, stared hard, and straightened up with
an exclamation. “You must have mesmerized me into
seeing that before. It’s certainly not there now, and
the light is excellent. What do you make of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What we don’t know won’t hurt us,” said Jarrad
with a slow shake of the head. “Initial this erasure,
will you. What’s next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins looked troubled, and a little anxious.
“But I say—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I began just the way you’re going on now, but
I got over it. I suggest that so far as this room is
concerned we just count the books and articles of
furniture, pass on their general condition, and call the
thing a go. Your clients are not the kind who give me
any worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins nodded and began the recital, reading from
the book in a rapid and level singsong as though he
were chanting the creed of his profession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General condition excellent,” he concluded, and
shut the book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad shook his head. “I can’t agree to that
now. The maintenance is not what it was. Quite
obvious that the housemaid is untrained or lazy; possibly
both. Look at this mantel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew a finger across the top of the mantel behind
the clock, and left a faint trail where the dust had
been displaced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t do that the last time we were here. No,
the upkeep is not as good. Condition fair, I should
say, at the most. See for yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins sniffed and investigated. “Perhaps you’re
right. I suppose my client is a little short of help.
All right, ‘condition fair.’ Anything else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jarrad glanced at the hearth. “Yes, one thing.
One fireplace tile split. You have no note of that, I
think, and it’s the only real damage we’ve seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ve nothing here. Let me see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was bending over the hearth when Derrick came
in. Jarrad made his well-known bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have just completed this room, sir, and the
only real dilapidation we find is in this hearth. It’s
a small matter, but nothing is too small for us to note.
Perhaps you may remember when it happened, as
it’s evidently quite recent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Derrick stared at the cracked tile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said slowly, “I remember that very distinctly.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
